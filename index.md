# A quick look at prominent topics relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic

From the New York Times (NYT) & the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) opinions section are many stories that represent the core discourse surrounding current events in the media. 

Applying topic modelling on collections of these opinions helps display the main topics of discussion that they focus on (in this example, what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that were most discussed), as well as the terms used to describe and discuss these topics.

In an attempt to identify 25 most prominent topics in the invididual collections of NYT and WSJ opinions from 2020, we found 4 topics from the NYT, and 5 topics from the WSJ that were relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The topics in the NYT seems to focus more on people, the spread of the pandemic and preventative measures, whereas the WSJ topics seem to focus more on the economic impact of the pandemic and relevant political choices such as healthcare access and schooling.

In a different attempt to identify 25 most prominent topics in the combined collection of NYT and WSJ opinions from 2020, we found 3 COVID-related topics, which largely aligns with the observation above.
