# A quick look at prominent topics relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic
From the New York Times (NYT) & the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) opinions section are many stories that represent the core discourse surrounding current events in the media. 

Applying topic modelling on collections of these opinions helps display the main topics of discussion that they focus on (in this example, what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that were most discussed), as well as the terms used to describe and discuss these topics.

In an attempt to identify 25 most prominent topics in the invididual collections of NYT and WSJ opinions from 2020, we found 4 topics from the NYT, and 5 topics from the WSJ that were relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A different attempt to identify 25 most prominent topics in the combined collection of NYT and WSJ opinions from 2020, we found 3 COVID-related topics.
