When and how did your “American dream” die? This is the question the artist Lizania Cruz puts to readers of her project “Obituaries of the American Dream,” commissioned by El Museo del Barrio in New York to feature in its first national survey of contemporary work by Latinx artists. The project defines the “American dream” as “the ideal that all individuals can achieve upward mobility based on their hard work” and invites the public to share their experiences, which she posts daily on the project’s website.
