SALT LAKE CITY â€” On May 3, 2017, I found myself in an unusual position: standing before the office of the Department of Homeland Security here, bullhorn in hand, leading a prayer vigil for a young mother. She was a Dreamer, brought to the United States when she was 7. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had arrested her just days before outside a craft store where she had taken her 8-year-old daughter to buy supplies for a birthday party.
