CLEVELAND — For the last two years, I have worked two jobs: one full-time position in food service at a grocery store, and one part-time as a receptionist at a hair salon. I took five days off in October to get married, and I haven’t had a vacation longer than that since 2017. I’ve worked every major holiday since then, too.
