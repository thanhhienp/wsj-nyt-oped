In his speech last week in Pittsburgh, Joe Biden pushed back against Donald Trumpâ€™s mischaracterization of him as soft on crime and beholden to progressives intent on defunding or abolishing police departments. He pledged to work with mayors and governors to tamp down violence. He also vowed to make progress on police reform, invoking the names of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Jacob Blake, and the cause of racial justice for which they have come to stand.
