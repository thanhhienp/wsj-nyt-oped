On the March weekend just before indoor dining in New York City was banned for the first time this year, I ate out on Friday night. I ate out on Saturday night, too. That was partly because I had a friend in town but mostly because I love restaurants. I live in restaurants. Many of us New Yorkers do — or, I should say, many of us New Yorkers did. We can’t live in restaurants anymore, and the consequence is that many restaurants no longer live.
