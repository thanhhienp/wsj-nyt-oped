In 2015, my life was thrown off-kilter. The year opened with my getting sick: an autoimmune condition that nobody could properly diagnose, which pushed my hormones into overdrive and rendered me unable to leave the apartment for weeklong stretches. My skin reacted to seemingly everything with a loud eruption of hives that covered my face, neck and body in a painful mosaic that made the thought of wearing clothes unbearable. As I pondered my new immobility, my husband lost his job and with it, our health insurance. And just as I thought weâ€™d figured out a way to get it all under control, my independent, healthy grandmother slipped in the middle of the night, hit her head and never woke up.
