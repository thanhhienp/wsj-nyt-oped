Super Tuesday was not the electric showing many fans of Bernie Sanders had hoped for. While some early projections forecast he would win as many as eight out of 14 states and amass a significant lead in pledged delegates, voters delivered a more modest outcome. Mr. Sanders won four states, including delegate-rich California, and ended the night nearly tied with Joe Biden in total pledged delegates. Most worrying for Mr. Sandersâ€™s campaign, the hoped-for youth turnout did not materialize, while Mr. Biden enjoyed the kind of suburban surge that handed Democrats the 2018 midterms.
