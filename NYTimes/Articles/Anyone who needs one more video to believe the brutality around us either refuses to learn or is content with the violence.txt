I was 18 when Rodney King was beaten. Videos of police brutality were rare then, but now I’m 47 and they are ubiquitous.

These videos are necessary not only because they generate outrage among whites, outrage that is ever-present for African-Americans. But also because the political leaders empowered to stop this are not outraged enough.
