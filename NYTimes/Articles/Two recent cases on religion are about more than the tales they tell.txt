Every Supreme Court decision tells a story, its author attempting to marshal the facts and the law in such a way as to make the conclusion appear not only obvious but inevitable. A divided decision will tell two or more competing stories, which is why I usually read dissenting opinions first. That way, by the time I get around to the majority opinion, Iâ€™m aware of the alternative narrative path that could have led the court to a different destination.
