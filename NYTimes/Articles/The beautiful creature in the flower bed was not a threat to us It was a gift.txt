NASHVILLE — The cabin my husband and I borrowed last week was first built in Kentucky on our friends’ family land more than 100 years ago. The timbers are rough-hewed, and you can still see the bark on some of the beams as the builders conserved every inch of the trees they felled from a forest that must have seemed endless. Our friends dismantled the cabin in 1987 and brought the timbers back to Tennessee, where they used them to build a new cabin on the Cumberland Plateau. It is now perched at the edge of a windswept bluff overlooking Lost Cove, one of the most biodiverse places in the world, right where the heavens come together with the earth.
