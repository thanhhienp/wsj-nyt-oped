Ajay Banga has spent a decade as chief executive of Mastercard. Last year, he oversaw $6.5 trillion in transactions. That means he knows what weâ€™re spending right now (aggregated and anonymized, of course) and how long it might take to get us out of our current economic funk. It also means Mr. Banga has leverage over virtually any business that relies on credit card payments. For example, following recent reporting from New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof on the scale of child pornography on Pornhub, Mastercard announced that it would terminate payments on that site.
