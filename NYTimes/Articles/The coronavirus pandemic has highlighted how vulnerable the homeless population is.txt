The coronavirus has infected over a million people around the world. As the pandemic sweeps across the country, tens of thousands of people are living on the streets of California. Last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California warned that as many as 60,000 homeless people could be infected with Covid-19, overwhelming the stateâ€™s health care systems. In Los Angeles County, where roughly 60,000 people are homeless, there are at least nine confirmed cases of coronavirus among unsheltered people.
