For the first time in as long as I can remember, I miss the salon. Which isn’t to say that I miss the many minutes or sometimes hours spent waiting for the hairdresser to take you, even though you arrived for your appointment early; or the punishing heat of the dryer, which makes you hot behind the ears and sweaty at the nape of your neck; or the inevitable rough tug of the hairdresser and the urgent apology — Sorry! — as she combs through a stubborn tangle.
