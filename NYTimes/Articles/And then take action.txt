I attended a program several years ago at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis that was part of an exhibition called “Hippie Modernism: The Struggle for Utopia.” The event was a celebration and reunion for some local countercultural civil rights and antiwar activists from the late ’60s and ’70s. One of the speakers, a young Native American man, caught my attention when he said: “You baby boomers have forgotten who you are. It’s time to step back up and finish what you started.”
