Imagine this: Just over the horizon, deep purple and orange skies, the sun setting behind emerald-green mountains. You and your partner are sitting close together, listening to the campfire musicians, while your children roast s’mores in the distance. You’re not even paying that much attention to them now — that’s what the summer camp counselors are for. Instead you’re sharing a laugh, about how terrible you were at rock climbing earlier that day. Those are exactly the kinds of restorative moments a family retreat at summer camp can provide.
