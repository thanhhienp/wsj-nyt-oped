An elaborate public funeral was held on Monday in Seoul, South Korea, in honor of the cityâ€™s mayor, Park Won-soon, a prominent human rights lawyer and confidant of President Moon Jae-in. Mr. Park was found dead last week, by suicide, hours after a personal assistant in his office filed a claim of sexual abuse and harassment against him.
