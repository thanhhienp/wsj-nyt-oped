I had a carefully laid out plan. On June 26, we would get married. Then we would begin trying to have a baby. If we were lucky, I would get pregnant sometime before we took up our new jobs in the fall, my husband in Jerusalem and me in Philadelphia, on a one-year academic fellowship. I would visit him for Christmas, and he would come for the final months of my pregnancy and the birth. I would use this time to write my book and I would join him in Jerusalem a year later, when I would begin a philosophy professorship, baby in tow.
