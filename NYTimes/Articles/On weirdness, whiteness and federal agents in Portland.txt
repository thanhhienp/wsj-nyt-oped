“Naked Athena.” Have you heard of her? She’s the woman who was so christened after she strolled into a recent Portland protest — one that was ostensibly, crucially, about Black lives — stark naked, save a mask (kudos to that) and skullcap. She sat down with her legs wide, and proceeded to do some yoga poses. Some say she was putting herself between protesters and police, that she was turning the cultural sacredness of a white (or at least a white-passing) woman’s body into a shield against rubber bullets and tear gas.
