My friend Kelsey doesn’t recommend getting dumped on your birthday. Valentine’s Day, I’ve heard, is also unideal. And while I can’t endorse breaking up on vacation in Hawaii with your entire family either, that ex and I do remain close friends, so perhaps there are worse ways to go than crying about irreconcilable differences over piña coladas.
