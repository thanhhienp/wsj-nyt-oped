I first heard about Club Quarantine through the queer grapevine: For three to six hours every night of the week, a queer dance party with people from all over the world was unfolding online over Zoom. My first evening in Club Quarantine, I kept my camera off. I was anxious about having my face broadcast to hundreds of strangers on the internet. But quickly that fear was replaced with awe; I attended the party each evening and increasingly became comfortable with my camera on. Whenever I logged onto Club Quarantine, hundreds of beautiful, brightly lit boxes twinkled at me. The short film above takes you into the virtual club, a peek into strangersâ€™ private worlds.
