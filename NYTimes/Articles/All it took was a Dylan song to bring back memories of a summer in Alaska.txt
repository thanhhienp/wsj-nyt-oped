It was Day 8 of quarantine for me and my family. My son had returned from his semester abroad in Europe, and so we were all hunkered down in our Brooklyn house, cooking, eating, working together and listening to music. Dean, 20, was mostly in charge of the soundtrack and had just put on Bob Dylan’s “Tonight I’ll Be Staying Here With You” on Spotify.
