I came to America from the Ivory Coast in 1993 at the age of 21 in pursuit of a better life. In the early days, I worked in a warehouse until a friend of mine talked to me about being a cabdriver. In 2001, I started driving a yellow taxi, leasing a medallion — the city permit that granted taxis’ exclusive rights to pick up passengers. I thought I had achieved my dream in 2004 when I was able to buy my own city taxi medallion.
