I am a translator and interpreter for asylum seekers held at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, and elsewhere in the country. I had never imagined that there could be more urgency around the work I do. The detainees I talk to are afraid of being deported, or being held indefinitely. Some are sick over being separated from their children, and unable to protect them from harm. Over the past few days, those concerns are increasingly being eclipsed by the fear of being infected with the coronavirus and dying alone in jail.
