DECATUR, Ga. — Last year, on Easter Monday, my friend Genia — a 47-year-old woman in my congregation, a mother of two kids the same ages as my own — died of breast cancer. Ten years ago, she was the first person I met after my husband and I arrived here from New York City to co-pastor the church her extended family had helped start generations before.
