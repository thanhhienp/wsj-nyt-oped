My mom drove me to my high school for the last time this morning. I walked through the halls, while I was on the phone with my A.P. government classmates for the last time. I was still saying goodbye to my classmates over the phone when I returned my textbook in the gym. Then I walked to my locker and tucked binders, a letter my English teacher encouraged us to write to ourselves at the beginning of the year and the pocket constitution I had left behind into my periwinkle backpack.
