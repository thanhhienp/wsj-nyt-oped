FRIDAY HARBOR, Wash. â€” Six years ago, I began investigating starfish dying by the millions off the West Coast of the United States from a mysterious wasting disease.

These predators are important to the health of kelp forests, and their demise has thinned or destroyed these places and their bountiful biodiversity. A virus is believed to be the cause.
