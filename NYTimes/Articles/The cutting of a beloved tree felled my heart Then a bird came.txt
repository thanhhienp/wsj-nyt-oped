I bought my house in Oregon without ever having set foot in it, without ever having even been to the state. I bought it knowing I might never make it here, that I’d have to risk my life to try. In my rowhouse in the clatter of Washington, D.C., my only view was the back of another house, about as far as I’d ever been able to see during years spent largely housebound with an illness that was finally beginning to let me go.
