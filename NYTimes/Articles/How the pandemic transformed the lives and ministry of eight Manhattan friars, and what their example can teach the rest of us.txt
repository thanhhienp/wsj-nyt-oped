Hugh Vincent Dyer, a 45-year-old Catholic friar, begins his days now in a sealed nursing home in Manhattan. He celebrates Mass in an empty chapel. The service is broadcast over closed-circuit television into residents’ rooms. “And I preach,” he told me, “because the people are listening,” even though there are no eyes in the chapel to reflect recognition, and no heads to bow in thanks. “I say a prayer of spiritual communion, because they can’t physically receive the sacrament.”
