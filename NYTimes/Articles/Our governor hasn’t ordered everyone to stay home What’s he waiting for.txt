OMAHA — The former rail route known as the Field Club Trail is a beautiful, popular pathway here. Wide and meandering with nearly two miles of paved trail through historic neighborhoods and verdant forests, this connective artery has allowed people to explore midtown for some 25 years. On a recent warm afternoon, with everything newly green, the trail looked like heaven for everyone enjoying nature’s splendor after a long and disheartening winter.
