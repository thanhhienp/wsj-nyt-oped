LOUDONVILLE, N.Y. — A few weeks back, our 9-year-old neighbor, Nealy, cornered me in the driveway. Since summer camp was canceled, she said, and because she is technically too young to babysit (though fully capable of doing so), she wanted to offer her services as a mother’s helper. She would come over and watch my children — ages 20 months and just-turned-3 — so that I could get things done around the house.
