As a self-employed writer, I often work at home, and have done so for years. This can be great — 10-second commute! writing in pajamas! — but comes with its own challenges. Some people get distracted and spend the day washing dishes, watering plants, organizing socks. Others suffer from having no one to report to. My personal demon is loneliness. After a day of struggling with a book chapter, a process that can feel like mud-wrestling a giant squid, the lack of company can leave me awfully bleak. That’s why I joined a virtual co-working group.
