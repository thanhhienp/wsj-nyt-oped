During the coronavirus lockdown, a fifth-grade teacher, Linda, contacted me asking for help. She teaches in a school district in Southern California where over 80 percent of the students qualify for free lunches. Linda was struggling with students’ not showing up for online class. “Before the lockdown, I had started reading ‘It Ain’t So Awful, Falafel,’ so I thought of asking if you have any ideas,” she said. “The kids all related to your story about being an immigrant and having to translate for your mom.”
