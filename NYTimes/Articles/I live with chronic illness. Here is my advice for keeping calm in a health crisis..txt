I am standing near the door of the subway car as the train on the Seventh Avenue line comes to an abrupt stop. As I reach out and grab the metal pole in the middle of the car to steady myself, I look up and find that all eyes are on me. They are indignant, it seems, that I grabbed the pole with my hand after just coughing into the crook of my elbow.
