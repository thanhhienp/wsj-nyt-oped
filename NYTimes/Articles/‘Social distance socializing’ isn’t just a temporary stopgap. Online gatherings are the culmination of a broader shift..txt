Last week, I went to the opera with a few friends. We dressed up, exchanged pleasantries, and toasted with prosecco at intermission. A day later I went to my favorite queer singalong piano bar, Marie’s Crisis, in the West Village, tipping my favorite pianist, the regular Friday bartender. I planned a workout class with a friend who lived in the neighborhood, a brunch and play reading with a group of theatrically minded friends. I said Compline — a traditional Christian nighttime prayer — with friends from church.
