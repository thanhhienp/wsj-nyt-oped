HAINES, Alaska — When I first saw the big electronic sign at the corner by the school and Mountain Market flashing “Stay Home” and “Save Lives,” it was like a warning light for my heart. When a refrigerated shipping container was placed behind the fire hall to serve as a temporary morgue (our regular one can hold only two people), I felt I couldn’t breathe. The fire chief said he didn’t mean to frighten anyone.
