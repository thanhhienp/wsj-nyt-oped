I teach philosophy to college students, and there was no way I was going to give them exams this semester, with our classes being held online. Why not? Simple â€” cheating. It is nothing personal with these particular students, but I have read enough psychological research to know that it would be very hard for them to resist looking for help in places where they are not supposed to, such as their notes, their friends and the internet.
