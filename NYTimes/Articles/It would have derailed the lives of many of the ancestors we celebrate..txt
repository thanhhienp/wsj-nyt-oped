Americans love stories about immigrants — especially when they are about our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. We admire these people’s courage and grit. We acknowledge their sacrifices and the vital roles they played in getting us where we are and building this country. My own grandfather, an immigrant from Mexico, worked as a taxi driver and a gravedigger, among other occupations, to support his family. Today we count professors and lawyers among his progeny.
