My grandmother left her recipes in fragments. There’s her little black book, scribbles of ingredients in English, French and Ladino, the language once spoken by the Jews of Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey. In one recipe, Savta, grandma in Hebrew, based measurements on a yogurt cup which she called un gobelet. According to my mom, they didn’t see a measuring cup until they moved from Israel to America in the early 1970s.
