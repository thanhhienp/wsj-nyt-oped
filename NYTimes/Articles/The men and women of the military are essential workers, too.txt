When I met the woman who would become my wife, it was 2001, we were in college, and she already knew that she wanted to join the military. The Navy would pay for her medical school, freeing her of debt. Military service was not a part of my plans, but love makes fools of us all. Since my wooing was already on shaky ground, I smiled and said, “That sounds great.” I knew then that if we started dating, I would be beginning a relationship with the military as well.
