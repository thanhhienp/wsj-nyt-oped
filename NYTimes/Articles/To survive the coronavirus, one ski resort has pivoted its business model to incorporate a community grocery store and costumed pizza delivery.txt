CORTLAND, N.Y. â€” In mid-March, after 112 days of being open for the ski season, Greek Peak Mountain Resort shut down its chair lifts and snow-making machines. The hotel and indoor water park closed for business, and preparations for the spring wedding and mountain biking season were put on hold. The staff of 500 was reduced to 17. Greek Peak is an economic powerhouse in central New York. Those layoffs have enormous ripples.
