A few years ago I got a note from a reader (written in the tone of patient disappointment with which you might discuss pants-wearing with a naked toddler) about parentheses. I used altogether too many of them, apparently. I tried to make them hold more than their listed storage capacity. I may as well have stamped the page with coffee rings.
