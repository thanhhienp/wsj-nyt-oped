RAMALLAH, West Bank — As New York City was moving toward a full confinement mode, I got an email from the daughter of a Palestinian friend from the West Bank. She lives and works in the city and was looking for advice from a veteran of long-term confinements. “I was too young at the time of the Israeli military curfew in 2002 to remember,” she wrote, and then asked: “How did you all manage?”
