In a small auditorium at St. Ann’s Center for Children, Youth and Families in Hyattsville, Md., 26-year-old Susana Chiang and I talk softly through our masks. Nearby is a well-loved plastic playhouse, where Ms. Chiang’s 4-year-old daughter is preparing us pretend food. She serves invisible ice cream and pasta with pepper and eggs. Children always seem taken with the essential vocations — food service, mail delivery, health care, parenthood — as though they’re born with a sense of what’s important in the world.
