A colleague who just returned from Hackensack University Medical Center tells her that the hospital’s refrigerated trailers, one of which arrived that day, were already at capacity. Each holds about 50 bodies — and that’s in addition to the hospital’s two morgues. “They’re full already?” Ms. Bensimon’s voice cracks. “Oh God.”
