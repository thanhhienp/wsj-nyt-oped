I call my mother every afternoon to check in on her. She lives in a three-story Section 8 building in East New York, Brooklyn, in the apartment my siblings and I grew up in. Three of her neighbors died from Covid-19 in the last two weeks, and more than half of the families in her 12-unit building are sick. Through the walls she could hear the wails of the family who lost a loved one to the virus next door: “Don’t go! Please don’t leave us!” Another neighbor on the second floor, a middle-aged Ecuadorean man who lived with his elderly mother, died the day before Easter. The worst part, she said, is not being able to pay her respects in person, to say goodbye to the neighbors that over the years have become her family. I feel my stomach turn with guilt.
