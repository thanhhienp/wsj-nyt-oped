Mike Vavalle, 37, likes to joke that being the clubhouse manager for the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, a Class AA affiliate of the Mets in Binghamton, N.Y., is really just “glorified babysitting.” In the spring and summer, he keeps the NYSEG Stadium clubhouse clean and outfitted with meals and snacks. He washes players’ uniforms. He even runs errands for Rumble Ponies players, who are often at the stadium from midmorning until late at night and don’t have time to, say, drop off a rent check.
