PARIS — When Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Union, warned decades ago that Europe would be forged through crises and “would be the sum of its solutions,” little could he have imagined that his prediction would one day be put to the test by a virus. On Monday, speaking jointly onscreen from their respective capitals, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France emerged from what Ms. Merkel described as “the most serious crisis of the E.U.’s history” and announced that they had found a solution.
