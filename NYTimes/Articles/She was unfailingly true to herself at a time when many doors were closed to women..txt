My father once asked his mother, the artist Annette Nancarrow, what she thought of Leon Trotsky. It wasnâ€™t a political question. He just wanted her impression of the exiled Bolshevik, whom she had first met in Mexico City in the late 1930s, in the studio of her close friend (and, my father suspected, future lover) Diego Rivera.
