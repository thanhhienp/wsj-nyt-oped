Recently, I quietly (and socially distantly) celebrated my 88th birthday. Some people might say that, even in good times, looking toward the future at my age is an act of optimism. But a life in the theater is built on exactly that kind of blind confidence, and Iâ€™ve spent my life pretty much always looking forward to whatever was the next thing: the next role, the next milestone, the next great show to see.
