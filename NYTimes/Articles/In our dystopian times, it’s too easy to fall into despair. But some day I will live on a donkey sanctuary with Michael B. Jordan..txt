I had a real spring in my step after leaving Chase Bank in December. I didn’t just leave the branch, I left the bank — properly and forever: Closed my account, took my money back, peaced right out of there. I felt like doing that Fred Astaire move where he jumps up and clicks his heels, but I didn’t. I’m kind of a nervous person and there were teenagers close by. I was giddy because I’d finally fulfilled a promise to myself, that I would leave Chase and stop helping them destroy the planet.
