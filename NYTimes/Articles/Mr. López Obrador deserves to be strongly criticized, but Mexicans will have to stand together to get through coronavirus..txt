MEXICO CITY — On March 4, a few days after the first coronavirus case was discovered here, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was asked about the infection at his daily news conference. “With the coronavirus, this idea that you can’t hug,” the president said. “You have to hug. Nothing happens.” He crossed his arms and hugged himself, a signature gesture that he uses to show him hugging the Mexican people.
