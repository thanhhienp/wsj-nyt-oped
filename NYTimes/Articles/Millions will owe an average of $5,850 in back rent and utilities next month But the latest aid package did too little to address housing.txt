The long-awaited new pandemic relief package, at $900 billion in aid, is good, though it’s no CARES Act. It’s smaller and shorter, operating on a scale of weeks, not months. Until spring, those with jobless benefits will get an extra $300 per week; the long-term unemployed will get extra weeks of benefits; and eligibility for benefits will remain broadened. Several other key programs will be extended for weeks as well. Yet even with these extensions, because of Congress’s long holdup in passing the package it could take several weeks to reinstate lapsed benefits, which will leave many beneficiaries still struggling with January rent and bills.
