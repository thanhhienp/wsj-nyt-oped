On Thursday, as the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny was returning to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tomsk, where he had been meeting with opposition candidates ahead of local elections, he began to feel ill. A heart-rending video was later posted online — one of the passengers on the plane had managed to capture Mr. Navalny’s groans and cries of pain. They sounded like the screams of a dying man.
