If you’re a normal human being considering reading this post, fair warning: although it’s not super-technical, it’s aimed at a very wonky audience, and parts of it won’t exactly be in English. Also, it’s of limited policy relevance: the Trump administration would never consider the policy I suggest, and even a Biden administration would probably balk at going where I suggest. The only reason I’m writing about it is to get the idea out there. Oh, and I don’t think it’s very different from what Larry Summers has been saying, but I thought it might be helpful to put some stylized numbers to what I believe, and believe he believes.
