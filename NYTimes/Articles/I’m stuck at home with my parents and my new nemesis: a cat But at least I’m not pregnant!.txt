COBH, Ireland — I’m a brown-haired woman and I usually feel fine about it. But in rocky times, existential or personal, my hair is the first problem on my list. The drumbeat starts, and I can’t ignore it. Change your hair, change your hair. I will. As soon as everything goes back to normal and I get home to Brooklyn, I know a Russian lady who will dye my hair a warm red-brown color.
