Iâ€™ve spent the spring and summer becoming a verified Lawn Dad: the sort of person who fills their time fine-tuning sprinkler patterns and surveying their handiwork each morning with a cup of coffee in hand. I spent a May afternoon hacking away an ancient juniper, an entire day pruning an unruly lilac. Piles of bark were spread. A patio was redone. An entire deck was sanded and re-stained.
