FORCALQUIER, France — Last Saturday, I got pulled over by the police for the first time ever. I was running, not driving, when the dark blue van pulled up behind me and the officer told me to stop on the side of a dusty road in Provence. My heart was already pumping hard from the steady incline, but my breath quickened when they asked where I lived and requested my “attestation.”
