One recent Thursday, I sent my 14- and 15-year-old boys off to the skate park near our house. I’m a parent who values a childhood lived outdoors. To that end, I’ve been a fairly free-range mom with my four kids, but as they left for the park, I gave them a warning that still feels foreign, even eight months into this pandemic. “Leave your masks on!” They both gave a nod of agreement and were off.
