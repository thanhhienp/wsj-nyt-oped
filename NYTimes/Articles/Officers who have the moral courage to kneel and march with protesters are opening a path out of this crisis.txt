As a college junior, I had the good fortune to audit a graduate seminar on leadership taught by retired Gen. John Galvin, the former commander of NATO. One of our readings was an October 1970 Life magazine profile of the infantry battalion he led in Vietnam, titled “You Can’t Just Hand Out Orders.” The article enumerated the political, racial and other disciplinary challenges he faced leading draftees in the waning days of an extremely unpopular war. After class, I approached the general. I wanted to know if war crimes had been a problem for his troops, and in what way. Had it affected them after they came home? The My Lai massacre had occurred the year before, he explained, making the population more hostile and his tour more dangerous. “At times,” he said, “it felt like we were also the victims of that crime.”
