On March 13, as New York City schools let out for what turned out to be their last official day and offices were telling their employees to work from home, I came down with an ominous fever and chills, and my business partner and I closed our two Brooklyn bar-restaurants. By the next week I would be diagnosed with Covid-19, and the week after that I would develop pneumonia. I spent four weeks bedridden, isolated from my family, at times immobilized with terror that I wouldn’t survive the night. When the virus released its grip and I could finally sit up in bed, my first impulse was to email my staff: We’re back in business!
