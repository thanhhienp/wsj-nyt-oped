I had loaned my body to America. That’s what the Navy doctor said, as he poked and prodded me in his office during my separation physical. After eight years in the Marines and two wars, I was in remarkably good shape, so I didn’t expect to receive any disability from the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, my doctor wasn’t entirely convinced. When he asked whether I suffered chronic pain from the grenade shrapnel in my back, I said no. When he asked whether I suffered blackouts or short-term memory loss after a handful of head-ringing encounters with improvised explosive devices, I again said no. Still, he recommended me for disability. The reason: hearing loss. I had passed my audiogram but, according to the doctor, that didn’t matter. Someday, I’d likely need hearing aids, he said, and the government had to budget for that. “You loaned society your body,” he said. “It’s our obligation to return it to you with interest.”
