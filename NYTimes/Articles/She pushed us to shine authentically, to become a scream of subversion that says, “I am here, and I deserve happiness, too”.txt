As a Latina, physical touch and embraces are part of how I cope with the pain of grief. The coronavirus robs us of those touches, of that intimacy. I miss the tears of my friends touching my own face as we hold each other, breathing the same air in silent mourning, in place of answers we canâ€™t give or have. In the past, my friend Lorena Borjas and I have grieved that way for others. The virus has now also taken that from me.
