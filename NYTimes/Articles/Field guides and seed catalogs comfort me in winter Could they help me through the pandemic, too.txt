NASHVILLE — My mother spent every winter thumbing through seed catalogs and gardening books. “What Flower Is That?,” an encyclopedic volume by an Australian writer named Stirling Macoboy, was her favorite. Mom fell asleep by eight every night, even with all the lights on in the house, even with my father and all three of us kids watching television in the big bed beside her. But she got up before dawn every morning, long before the rest of us, and if I ever happened to wake up early myself, I could find her on the living room sofa with “What Flower Is That?” open in her lap. It contains more than a thousand color photos of flowers from around the world.
