Today’s sightings: red paisley mask, pleated pink flowered mask, black VOTE mask, yellow smiley-face mask, Etsy bedazzled mask, Spiderman mask. Lots of surgical-blue paper masks. A few hard-shell N95s. One or two navy bandit gaiters. (Me, I’m under the grinning-wolf mask.) Most masks hide who we are and let us try on different identities, but these disguises give me clues to the wearer underneath.
