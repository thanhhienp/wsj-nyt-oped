I’m awake before my alarm goes off. I make coffee, wash my face and put deodorant on twice. The deodorant is never enough to stop the sweat and smell, but I try. My husband and kids are still asleep. I try to eat. My stomach turns as I imagine what today will bring, though of course I know. It’s always variations on the same theme: Critically ill patients who all have been given the same diagnosis, Covid-19.
