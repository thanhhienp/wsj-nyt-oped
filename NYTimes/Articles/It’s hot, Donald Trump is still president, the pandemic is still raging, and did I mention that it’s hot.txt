NASHVILLE — August and February are the two months I like least. August because it’s hot and dry and the wildflowers are mostly spent. February because it’s cold and gray and by February I have lived too long without wildflowers. Thanks to climate change, February doesn’t get all that cold anymore, though it’s still gray. February will always be gray in Middle Tennessee.
