Once, my life was made of bread. I was the pastor of a “dinner church” where our worship took the form of a meal we cooked and ate together. Our church was filled not with pews, but with tables. Not with the heady smell of incense, but onions softening in olive oil and rosemary as the bread warmed in the oven.
