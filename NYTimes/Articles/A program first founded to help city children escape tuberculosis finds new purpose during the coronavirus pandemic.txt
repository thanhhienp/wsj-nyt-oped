For Karen Arroyo, a medical assistant at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, the night hours now seem to collapse into one another. She moves among Covid-19 patients who are too weak to speak to her. She checks their vital signs and cleans them off when theyâ€™re soiled. She wraps up those who are deceased and prepares them to be transported to the morgue. When Ms. Arroyo gets home at 7 a.m., she sprays her clothes down with Lysol so as not to expose her family.
