When President Trump recognized Juan Guaidó, president of the Venezuelan National Assembly, as “the true and legitimate president of Venezuela” during the State of the Union address on Tuesday, Mr. Guaidó received two bipartisan standing ovations. The recognition included a commitment from Mr. Trump that Nicolás Maduro’s “grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken.” It was a unifying moment in a divisive address. Mr. Guaidó then spent a night at Blair House, reserved for foreign dignitaries, with the Venezuelan flag flying out front, and met with Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday.
