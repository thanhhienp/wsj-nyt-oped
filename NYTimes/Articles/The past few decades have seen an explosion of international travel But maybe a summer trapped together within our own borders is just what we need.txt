LONDON — For us, it was supposed to be France — a big house in a soporific Breton village, with 16 members of my partner’s family. Her bon vivant father, who recently completed chemotherapy, had paid for the rental to celebrate with two weeks surrounded by grandkids and half-empty bottles of Beaujolais. Everyone had been looking forward to it all year. It is only in the past two weeks, after France announced an 18 billion euro (about $20 billion) “Marshall Plan” to place its vital tourist sector on life support, that I finally conceded that the trip isn’t going to happen.
