I’ve always hated cooking. My mother thought it was drudgery; her mother felt the same. As for me, a tech worker, I hid in my profession’s disdain for inefficiency. The calculus of exchanging time or money for feeding my family never balanced in cooking’s favor. For a perfectionist like me (another matrilineal inheritance) long recipes looked like baroque forms of self-torture; there wasn’t even time to shop at the good grocery store.
