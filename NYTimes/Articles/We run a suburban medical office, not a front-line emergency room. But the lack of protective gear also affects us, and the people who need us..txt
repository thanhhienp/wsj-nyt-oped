Over 12 days ago, when I walked into my otolaryngology office in Westchester County, N.Y., my office manager gave me one high-grade N-95 mask. These masks are not supposed to be reusable, but somehow I had to make it last: We didn’t have any more. I later learned that we only had 25 protective gowns — likewise designed to be single-use items — for an office of nine medical specialists. When I saw a delivery of protective medical equipment in our building the next day, I assumed it was for my office. Instead it was going to the lawyers’ office down the hall. We are finally getting 20 more masks, but our shortage remains acute.
