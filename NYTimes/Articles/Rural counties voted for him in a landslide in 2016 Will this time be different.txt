Rick Ainey lives on the northern tier of Pennsylvania, near the New York border in a region known as the Endless Mountains. The area is scenic, deeply rural and so reliably Republican that the last time it has given a majority of its votes to a Democratic presidential candidate was in 1964, when Lyndon Johnson crushed Barry Goldwater just about everywhere. The time before that was 1852, when the two major parties were the Democrats and the Whigs.
