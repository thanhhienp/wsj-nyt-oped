On the Nevada debate stage last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren flayed the billionaire Michael Bloomberg for Trumpish reviews of women’s looks. In South Carolina on Tuesday, she focused on a former employee’s allegation that Mr. Bloomberg told her to “kill it” upon hearing of her pregnancy. She was referring to a subgenre in the history of Mr. Bloomberg’s sexist remarks — one concerned specifically with mothers. In a 1998 lawsuit, a former employee alleged that Mr. Bloomberg had demanded, “What the hell did you do a thing like that for?” of a newly pregnant employee. The suit also says he cruelly dismissed another employee’s difficulty finding child care, saying of an infant: “It doesn’t know the difference between you and anyone else! All you need is some black who doesn’t even have to speak English to rescue it from a burning building!” The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed sum.
