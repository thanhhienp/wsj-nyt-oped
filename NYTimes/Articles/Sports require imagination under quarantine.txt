DURHAM, N.H. — On a recent Saturday, I joined my dad and younger sister in the driveway. It was sunny and brisk out, and we had nothing to do. We were bored of being inside. Without structure and scheduled events — no skating practice, no dance competitions, no track meets or water polo games or taekwondo — the empty stretch that was now our weekends was maddeningly slow.
