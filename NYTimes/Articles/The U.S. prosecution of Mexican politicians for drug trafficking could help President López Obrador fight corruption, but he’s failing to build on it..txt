MEXICO CITY — While the sex-crimes trial of Harvey Weinstein takes center stage, another case is winding through a New York court with shattering implications. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are pursuing drug trafficking charges against Genaro García Luna, a key architect of the drug war of former President Felipe Calderón. After Mr. García Luna’s latest hearing on Jan. 21, his lawyer reiterated that he pleas not guilty, saying he “adamantly denies that he accepted any bribes” (from traffickers) and will go to trial.
