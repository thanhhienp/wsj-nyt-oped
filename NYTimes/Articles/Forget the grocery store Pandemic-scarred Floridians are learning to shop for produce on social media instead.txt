HOMESTEAD, Fla. — As chickens pecked the ground around me, a young woman in a face mask signaled that it was my turn. I walked up to the farm stand and added tomatillos, lentils, fresh herbs, lettuce, avocados, eggs and even toilet paper to my basket. Everything was cheaper than it would have been at a grocery store in Miami, about a half-hour away, where items were sparse and the aisles were crowded. For about $40, I left with a big box of produce, while back home my sister’s Instacart bill inched ever closer to $300.
