My father turned 100 last week. Not in a nursing home or at an awkward family gathering with 1-0-0 candles on a cake. Not in his physical form at all â€” he died in 1976. But I marked his centennial because, to the few people left on earth who still grieve for him after nearly 44 years, it had to matter for just one day, as just a fleeting number in this life of constant additions and subtractions.
