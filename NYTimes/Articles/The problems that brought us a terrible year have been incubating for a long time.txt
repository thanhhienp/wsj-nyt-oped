In his classic story “Rip Van Winkle,” the author Washington Irving told the tale of an 18th-century American who drinks a potion and falls asleep for 20 years. Upon waking, he finds a world that has changed in shocking ways. (There’s been a revolution, for example, and the United States is now a thing.)
