Metformin, the world’s most widely prescribed diabetes drug, might do more than control diabetes. A study in Scotland in 2005 found that people taking metformin were 23 percent less likely to get cancer, suggesting that it might also prevent cancer. Other studies are exploring metformin’s ability to treat cancer, alone and in combination with other therapies.
