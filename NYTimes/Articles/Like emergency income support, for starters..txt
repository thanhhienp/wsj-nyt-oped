SEATTLE — I’m a single mother, and I’ve worked hard to stay in this city, where I grew up. I graduated from the University of Washington, but no employer would give me the flexibility I needed to care for my three girls. That’s why I started delivering food for Caviar five years ago. Now I do the same for Postmates, DoorDash, Uber Eats and Instacart. I also drive for Lyft.
