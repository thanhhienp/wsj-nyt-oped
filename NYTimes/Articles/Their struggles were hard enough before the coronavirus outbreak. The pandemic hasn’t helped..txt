LeVar Newsom is a full-time physical education and health teacher in San Antonio, but his workday doesn’t end when the bell rings at 3:20 p.m. On days when he’s not coaching football, soccer or basketball, he drives straight to his job as a carpet cleaner, where he works from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Then he goes home to grade papers and prepare lessons. Until recently, he also worked a night shift as a hospital technician — 10:45 p.m. to 6:45 a.m. — before returning to school by 7:15 a.m. He barely saw his wife and two young daughters.
