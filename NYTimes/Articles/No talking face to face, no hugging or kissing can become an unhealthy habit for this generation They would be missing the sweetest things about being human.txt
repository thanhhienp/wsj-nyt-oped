MIAMI — The door of Carlota’s room is ajar, so I peek inside to see what she’s doing. She’s sitting upright at her desk with her laptop in front of her. On the screen are a dozen of her schoolmates, all of them, like Carlota, participating in a virtual class. I can tell that their teacher is leading the lesson from her home — I’m pretty sure they’re discussing fractions and decimals — but Carlota and her friends are following closely along as if she were talking to them in person.
