Georgia begins early voting today in two runoffs that will decide the composition of the next U.S. Senate. If Democrats win both seats, the Senate will be split 50-50 (with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris acting as tiebreaker). If they donâ€™t, it will be controlled by Republicans who stand ready to block many actions of a Biden presidency.
