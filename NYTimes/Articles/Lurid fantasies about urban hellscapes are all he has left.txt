On Thursday morning I walked across much of Manhattan and back again. (Why are all the doctorsâ€™ offices on the East Side?) It was a beautiful day, and the city looked cheerful: Shops were open, people were drinking coffee in the sidewalk seating areas that have proliferated during the pandemic, Central Park was full of joggers and cyclists.
