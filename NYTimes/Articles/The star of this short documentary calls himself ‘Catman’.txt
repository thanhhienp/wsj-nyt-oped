In the Op-Doc above, we enter the world of an older man living by himself in a small city in Switzerland. Only he’s not alone — he has his two Scottish Fold cats, Marmelade and Katyusha. The cats accompany him everywhere: to the bar, to the grocery store, to the ski slopes. As we watch their relationship unfold, the trio builds a world that’s exclusively and intimately theirs alone — a reminder that families are whatever we make them out to be. All that defines them is love.
