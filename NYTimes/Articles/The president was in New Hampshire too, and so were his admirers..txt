MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump spoke for an hour to an enthusiastic crowd of more than 11,000 at the Southern New Hampshire University Arena on Monday night under banners that read “Promises Made” and “Promises Kept.” Two nights earlier, this same venue hosted the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s 100 Club dinner.
