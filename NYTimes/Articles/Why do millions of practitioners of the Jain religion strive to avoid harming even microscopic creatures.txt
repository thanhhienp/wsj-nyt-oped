This month’s conversation in our series exploring religion and death is with Pankaj Jain (@ProfPankajJain), an associate professor in the department of philosophy and religion at the University of North Texas. He is the author of “Dharma in America: A Short History of Hindu-Jain Diaspora,” “Dharma and Ecology of Hindu Communities: Sustenance and Sustainability” and other works. He is currently translating “Jain Darshan,” a text on the philosophy of Jainism. In 2019, he appeared in the TV series “The Story of God” with the actor Morgan Freeman.
