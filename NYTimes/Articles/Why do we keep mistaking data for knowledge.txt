In March, when the first spike of Covid-19 cases in New York was filling hospitals and panicking the city, my immunocompromised mother-in-law and my eight-months pregnant wife both contracted the disease. At first, it was just like a bad cold, but soon my wife was crying in pain every time she coughed and my mother-in-law could barely get out of bed. As my mother-in-lawâ€™s oxygen levels ticked down day by day, I would listen to her breathing and wonder whether I should bring her to a hospital.
