OXFORD, Miss. — I’m a proud Mississippian, and our state’s poet laureate, but I don’t fly the state flag. Neither do my friends and neighbors, white or black (I’m white). The reason is simple: Mississippi, which has the country’s highest percentage of black residents, is the last state in the nation to have a flag that incorporates the Confederate symbol.
