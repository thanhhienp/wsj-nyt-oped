Stuck at home and finished Netflix? These short documentaries are an instantaneous passport around the world. Go to Sundance and SXSW on your phone with our collection of Op-Docs from those festivals, or take in a number of Emmy- and Oscar- nominated films you canâ€™t find anywhere else. Spend seven minutes, or an afternoon, while you see deep space in a way no one has before, be in the zone with Slomo, meet the original fourth member of the Black Eyed Peas. Want to watch more? Our collection of over 300 films is available to watch from anywhere.
