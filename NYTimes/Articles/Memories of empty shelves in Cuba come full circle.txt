First, it was the hand sanitizer. Then, Clorox wipes, alcohol, thermometers and Tylenol vanished from the shelves. Soon after, the toilet paper was gone, and then the rolls of paper towels and the napkins, and all the cleaning products. After that, items that had nothing to do with disinfecting surfaces began disappearing as well: boxed unsweetened almond milk, cucumbers and my favorite sugar-free bar of chocolate. Yesterday, we couldnâ€™t get bacon in our local supermarket or Cookie Crisp cereal or honey ham, which my boys like.
