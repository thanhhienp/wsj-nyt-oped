I’m not sure when it came. I’m not exactly sure of the time or date or precise location in which the virus entered my body. I don’t know how long it was there or when exactly my body started to fight it. All I know is that 67 days after my wife and I packed our bags and left Utah for vacation, I found myself in quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, at a port in Yokohama, Japan, on Feb. 3; that six days later I’d come down with an intense fever and extreme nausea; and that on Valentine’s Day I would test positive for the new coronavirus.
