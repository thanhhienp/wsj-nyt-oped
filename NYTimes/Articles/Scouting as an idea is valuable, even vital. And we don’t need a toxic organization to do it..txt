Thirty years ago this summer, I spent two weeks backpacking across Philmont, a 140,000-acre expanse of northeastern New Mexico owned by the Boy Scouts of America. Most people who trek Philmont say it changed their life; it certainly changed mine. A few years later, I became an Eagle Scout â€” still one of my proudest achievements.
