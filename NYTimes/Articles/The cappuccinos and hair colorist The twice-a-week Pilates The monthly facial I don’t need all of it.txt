In my isolation, I frequently calculate the cost of my old life. The once-a-week trainer. The twice-a-week Pilates classes. The monthly facial, with the extra laser boost to work on acne scars and wrinkles. The pedicures, as much as I hated them, because who would go around with naked toes? The hair colorist. Regular theater tickets. Daily cappuccinos. Salads at Sweetgreen. Dinners at a perfectly fine but not amazing place for $70 a person, with such intense noise that conversation is prohibited.
