Los Angeles, a city created by social distancing, is right now a very lonely place. Lonely not because the residents are living apart, per the edicts to stay indoors to stop the spread of the coronavirus; living at home is normal here. Unlike in New York, the bulk of our lives plays out privately, behind trimmed bougainvillea and closed doors, not publicly in the streets and on sidewalks.
