A few weeks ago, or maybe it was a few months ago, I decided to watch my two favorite ’80s movies about working mothers: “Baby Boom,” a rom-com starring Diane Keaton as an advertising executive turned work-from-home applesauce mogul; and “Aliens,” James Cameron’s thriller centered around a woman’s struggle to defeat a race of genocidal aliens. Both mother-protagonists struggle with what has come to be known as “work-life balance.”
