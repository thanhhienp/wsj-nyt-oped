ISTANBUL — On Dec. 3, Ceren Ozdemir, a 20-year-old ballerina, spent most of her evening teaching ballet to children at a school in Ordu, a beautiful town on Turkey’s Black Sea coast. She walked home from the school and rang the bell at her building’s entrance. Her sister appeared at a window and tossed down the keys. When her sister noticed a man approach Ms. Ozdemir, she ran downstairs to check things out.
