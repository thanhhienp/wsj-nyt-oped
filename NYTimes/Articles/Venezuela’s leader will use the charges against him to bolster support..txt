MEXICO CITY — On Thursday, in the midst of the world’s most serious health and economic crisis since perhaps the Great Depression, the Trump administration charged President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela with narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and money laundering. The State Department offered a $15 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Mr. Maduro and also indicted other senior officials, including the country’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, who is charged with conspiracy to smuggle narcotics.
