When I founded Michael Angeloâ€™s Wonderland Beauty Parlor in the meatpacking district 15 years ago, I never imagined I would one day have to downsize and relocate to survive rising rents, only to have to then shut down for months. Nor could I conceive of having to choose between paying the rent on my apartment, paying the lease on the salon or putting food on the table.
