A few years ago, two Michigan prison inmates, proclaiming themselves adherents of the “Christian Identity” religion, sought the prison’s official recognition to be allowed to conduct their own worship services, apart from other inmates. The prison already recognized 20 religions, including a number of Christian denominations, but the two men said they couldn’t pray with others because their religion demanded “white separatism.” While they observed several Jewish holidays, including Passover and Yom Kippur, they said they couldn’t join Jewish inmates in prayer because “the Jewish faith denies Jesus Christ.”
