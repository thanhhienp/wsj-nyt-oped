I stood at my patient’s bedside as she picked at the sheets, eyes roving, seemingly unaware of my presence. When I placed my stethoscope on her chest, she started to moan. It was a sad sound, high-pitched and pleading. I set down the stethoscope and touched her hair with a gloved hand. “It’s OK,” I said through my N95, hoping that she could understand the meaning if not the words. “You’re safe. We’re taking care of you.”
