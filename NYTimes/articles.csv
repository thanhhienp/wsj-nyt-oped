It’s an unchoreographed aerial dance, a celebration of what happens when light marries earth and sky.

"What’s bad for America would be bad for corporations, too.txt","So the blue wave fell short of expectations.

An outdated culture allowed King Juan Carlos I to become a lobbyist for Arab dictatorships and to hide his fortune for decades.txt,"MADRID — One of my first assignments as a reporter, in 1996, was to interview an alleged lover of the king of Spain, Juan Carlos de Borbón y Borbón. My editors at El Mundo asked me to look into whether Bárbara Rey, a Spanish film and television actress, demanded money from the state in exchange for keeping her relationship with the married king secret. In the end, I didn’t get the interview. Under pressure, Ms. Rey chose to remain silent. Thus our king’s two great weaknesses — women and money — remained the country’s worst-kept secret for another two decades.

Federal support for cities and states was a core part of the New Deal The president is tearing it apart.txt,"When most people think of the New Deal, they think of the enduring institutions it created — above all, the web of agencies and programs that has provided the social safety net, such as it is, for life in the United States since the 1950s.

Harvey Weinstein’s conviction shows how cultural change is reshaping the criminal justice system..txt,"The guilty verdicts against Harvey Weinstein in a prosecution that faced long odds is more than a victory for the #MeToo movement that his case propelled. Even though he was acquitted of the most serious charges — two counts of predatory sexual assault — the outcome sends a signal that social and legal barriers that have long denied justice to victims of sexual assault are beginning to crumble.

Its ability to form a solid majority around a shared politics despite its many differences is a model for the party — and the nation.txt,"In coalition politics, every part of the coalition matters, especially when elections are close. For Democrats, Asian-Americans are suddenly crucial: They are the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in the U.S. electorate, constituting 4.7 percent of the voting population — enough to make a difference in the presidential contest in Georgia, where Joe Biden won by some 12,000 votes.

Schools must build cultures of physical distancing to protect campuses.txt,"Colleges and universities like ours are hoping to reopen campuses and resume in-person instruction in the fall, but they face significant physical and logistical obstacles in protecting their students. Residential colleges are sometimes described as “landlocked cruise ships,” because students live, eat, study and socialize together, often in close quarters. Under ordinary circumstances, that is a good thing. But such tightly knit campus communities are tailor-made for spreading an easily transmissible illness like the coronavirus.

High fees are cutting already thin margins to the bone.txt,"The sudden onset of the pandemic in March sent the restaurant industry into a death spiral.

The next president can undo some of the recent efforts to weaken environmental protections But it’ll take work.txt,"That the Interior Department has now blessed oil and gas drilling in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge comes as no surprise.

It’s clear what reforms are needed Some states are even implementing them.txt,"Since 2008, partisan distrust of presidential election results has been substantial. In 2016, only 43 percent of Democrats believed that the election was free and fair; now, only 30 percent of Republicans do. Each party’s supporters are more likely to believe that the vote was free and fair if they won, and those on the losing side are becoming more suspicious of the results. With a defeated president trying for weeks to overturn an election he has falsely called fraudulent, our partisan breach will be hard to repair.

And yet many continue to seize on this concern. The risk of spread of Covid-19 is clearly elevated at demonstrations: People are yelling, stirring up respiratory droplets and projecting them into the air; people are marching long distances, exerting themselves and taking gulps of air in the process; people are standing and kneeling much less than six feet from one another; and mask use is, over all, abundant but admittedly inconsistent.

The beautiful creature in the flower bed was not a threat to us It was a gift.txt,"NASHVILLE — The cabin my husband and I borrowed last week was first built in Kentucky on our friends’ family land more than 100 years ago.

Our friends dismantled the cabin in 1987 and brought the timbers back to Tennessee, where they used them to build a new cabin on the Cumberland Plateau.

How to reimagine the country’s memorial landscape.txt,"On July 9, former Vice President Joseph Biden announced a new slogan for his campaign: “Build Back Better.” In economic terms the tag line makes sense even if it lacks moral inspiration.

Officers who have the moral courage to kneel and march with protesters are opening a path out of this crisis.txt,"As a college junior, I had the good fortune to audit a graduate seminar on leadership taught by retired Gen.

After class, I approached the general. I wanted to know if war crimes had been a problem for his troops, and in what way. Had it affected them after they came home?

In the video op-ed above, Josiah Edwards explains what it was like to grow up breathing in the toxic chemicals expelled by drilling. He traces the asthma that plagues his entire family to decades of redlining in Los Angeles County, which consigned Black and brown communities like theirs to live next to active oil wells. Even today, politicians keep rejecting legislation that would help protect Californians from these poisonous emissions. You may not have an oil drill in your backyard now, but if you live in California, there’s nothing stopping one from moving in tomorrow.

Children bike and run freely, cars drive slowly through the neighborhoods, parents keep an eye on one another’s kids, uniformed service members pop home for lunch, and everybody knows your name.

The prison already recognized 20 religions, including a number of Christian denominations, but the two men said they couldn’t pray with others because their religion demanded “white separatism.” While they observed several Jewish holidays, including Passover and Yom Kippur, they said they couldn’t join Jewish inmates in prayer because “the Jewish faith denies Jesus Christ.”

Some reasons to doubt a theory that’s shared by liberals and Trump supporters alike.txt,"Two of the most intense factions in our politics, the anti-Trump Resistance with its claim to be standing against fascism and the conservatives trying to delegitimize Joe Biden’s victory with claims of widespread voter fraud, agree on almost nothing, but they do agree on one point: The Trump administration was successfully undermined — the Trump agenda thwarted and Donald Trump himself defeated — by liberal institutions that refused to normalize him, maintained a persistent alarm about his presidency and took every opportunity to obstruct, investigate, protest and impeach.

Trump has gone to the well one time too many.txt,"Donald Trump made his name in Republican Party politics as a “birther,” a true believer in — and an evangelist for — the racist conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was a foreign-born, illegitimate president.

Trump’s catastrophic performance has as much to do with psychology as ideology.txt,"Since the early days of the Trump administration, an impassioned group of mental health professionals have warned the public about the president’s cramped and disordered mind, a darkened attic of fluttering bats.

He’d see them floating on the water, motionless, covered in a slimy black substance.

Memories of empty shelves in Cuba come full circle.txt,"First, it was the hand sanitizer. Then, Clorox wipes, alcohol, thermometers and Tylenol vanished from the shelves. Soon after, the toilet paper was gone, and then the rolls of paper towels and the napkins, and all the cleaning products.

We know more about epilepsy than ever. But I am still trying to reckon with mine..txt,"Among the many special causes entrusted to the patronage of St. Valentine — beekeeping, love — is epilepsy, though no one seems to know exactly why. The great 20th-century psychiatrist Leo Kanner guessed in a 1930 paper on epileptic folklore that the association was earned by the similarity between the sound of Valentine’s name spoken in German and the epithet “fallende Sucht,” “the falling disease.” It may have been that over time, entreaties to Valentine from epileptics were answered with particular generosity. They needed all the help they could get. Kanner cites several other saints known to be patrons of epilepsy, whose names were given over time as euphemisms for the disease — St. John, St. Donato, St. Cornelius and scores more.

The debts our institutions owe to the problematic past can’t just be canceled.txt,"When it comes to hating Woodrow Wilson, I was an early adopter. Raised with the bland liberal history that hailed the 28th president as a visionary for championing the League of Nations, I picked up in college what was then a contrarian, mostly right-wing perspective — that many of Wilson’s legacies were disastrous, including an imperial understanding of the presidency that’s deformed our constitutional structure ever since, the messianic style in American foreign policy that gave us Vietnam and Iraq, and a solidification of Jim Crow under a scientific-racist guise.

Will we endure 2.2 million deaths Or will we manage to turn things around.txt,"Here’s the grimmest version of life a year from now: More than two million Americans have died from the new coronavirus, almost all mourned without funerals. Countless others have died because hospitals are too overwhelmed to deal adequately with heart attacks, asthma and diabetic crises. The economy has cratered into a depression, for fiscal and monetary policy are ineffective when people fear going out, businesses are closed and tens of millions of people are unemployed. A vaccine still seems far off, immunity among those who have recovered proves fleeting and the coronavirus has joined the seasonal flu as a recurring peril.

What it means that my generation is the future of the GOP.txt,"If, as seems possible, Joe Biden wins the presidency by peeling away older white voters from the Republican coalition, liberals won’t just win the White House; they’ll gain a new generational villain to bemoan.

It’s not just a negative state to be vanquished. There’s magic in it too..txt,"In the winter of 1942, shortly after Pearl Harbor was attacked, Edward Hopper began a new painting: a New York City diner at night, seen from outside, its four alienated inhabitants trapped behind a bubble of green glass. Of all Hopper’s paintings, “Nighthawks” encapsulates urban loneliness, the feeling of being unable to connect despite being surrounded by millions of others. Over the decades, it’s become so emblematic of this unhappy state that it’s regularly subject to parody. Sometimes the melancholy incumbents wear party hats; sometimes the diner floats in space. This week, a new version started circulating on social media. All the color had drained away. The people had vanished. The diner was empty.

A candidate who calls himself a democratic socialist wouldn’t seem to be the likely savior of Democratic politics in Texas..txt,"There are a lot of things I thought I would never see happen in Texas politics. Just to pick a few across a vast and varied spectrum: Ann Richards’s election to the governorship in 1990 seemed miraculous — a sign that Texas had turned a corner and was finally heading in a progressive direction. Of course it didn’t, as we saw with her successor George W.

He would nominate a cadre of reliably conservative judges, handpicked by the Federalist Society and backed by groups like the Judicial Crisis Network, to lifetime positions on the federal bench, where they would write conservative ideology into the Constitution under the cover of an “originalism” that conveniently and consistently aligns with Republican Party political preferences.

America has no monopoly on success.txt,"You might call it poetic, if it weren’t so painful. Donald Trump won the White House largely on a campaign of shutting America’s borders to pretty much everyone other than people of European descent. “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” he once asked, about Haitians, Salvadorans and Africans. “We should have more people from places like Norway.”

For many of us, that means taking our daily activities — work, school, medical care and connecting with loved ones — online. But not for everyone. The coming weeks will lay bare the already-cruel reality of the digital divide: tens of millions of Americans cannot access or cannot afford the home broadband connections they need to telework, access medical information and help young people learn when school is closed. When public health requires social distancing and even quarantine, closing the digital divide becomes central to our safety and economic security.

But in the course of social distancing to mitigate the spread, we may also be unintentionally inhibiting the proper development of children’s immune systems.

These videos are necessary not only because they generate outrage among whites, outrage that is ever-present for African-Americans.

"The career of the coronavirus so far is, in Darwinian terms, a great success story.txt","No sensible person can dispute that Covid-19 is a great tragedy for humanity — a tragedy even in the ancient Greek sense, as defined by Aristotle, with the disastrous ending contingent on some prideful flaw in the protagonist. This time it’s not Oedipus or Agamemnon. This time it’s we who are that cocky protagonist, having brought disaster on ourselves. The scope and the devastation of the pandemic reflect bad luck, yes, and a dangerous world, yes, but also catastrophic failures of human foresight, communal will and leadership.

Should masks be stored with the underwear or with the socks.txt,"Recently, at a funeral, I got to thinking about the lesser challenges of the mask. Not the should-you-or-shouldn’t-you, which is settled science at this point, but the specific problem of how to cry with a mask on. This was especially pressing for me because, as an incorrigible weeper — it doesn’t matter if I’m a third friend twice removed — I was streaming tears before the service had begun. But the mask posed a new challenge: How to blow my nose discreetly and with enough frequency that I didn’t wind up with a big wet splotch in the middle, surely a repellent look during a raging pandemic? How to lift my mask to do the requisite wiping without someone looking askance?

Beware a despot when he’s cornered.txt,"Two weeks ago, I wrote that perhaps, at long last, we had reached a tipping point in Trump’s popularity, and I stand by it. On Thursday, a poll conducted by Fox News (Fox!) showed him trailing Biden by 12 percentage points; the Tulsa arena hosting his comeback rally on Saturday was two-thirds empty.

Facing death can be a key to our liberation and survival.txt,"We’re scared. We’re on edge, unable to concentrate. We can’t find focus. Our minds flit and float around flealike from one update to the next. We follow the news, because we feel we should. And then we wish we hadn’t, because it’s terrifying and sad. Daytime naps seem involuntary and fitful. Sleep will often not descend. But when it does, we sometimes wake, in a mortal panic, with hypochondriac symptoms we feel to be real but we know are not; and then we feel selfishly stupid for having them in the first place. We take our temperature. We wait. We take it again. It goes on. Feelings of powerlessness and ennui slide into impotent rage at what is being done and, most of all, what is not being done, or is being done poorly, irresponsibly, dishonestly.

"The coronavirus forced a shift to virtual classes, but their continuation could be beneficial even after the pandemic ends.txt","Forty years ago, going to college in America was a reliable pathway for upward mobility. Today, it has become yet another 21st-century symbol of privilege for the wealthy. Through this period, tuition rates soared 260 percent, double the rate of inflation. In 2019, the average cost of attending a four-year private college was over $200,000. For a four-year public college, it was over $100,000. To sustain these prices, more students are now admitted from the top 1 percent of the income scale than the entire bottom 40 percent at the top 80 colleges. Universities have also opened the floodgates to wealthy international students, willing to pay full tuition for the American brand.

That’s what the Navy doctor said, as he poked and prodded me in his office during my separation physical. After eight years in the Marines and two wars, I was in remarkably good shape, so I didn’t expect to receive any disability from the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, my doctor wasn’t entirely convinced. When he asked whether I suffered chronic pain from the grenade shrapnel in my back, I said no. When he asked whether I suffered blackouts or short-term memory loss after a handful of head-ringing encounters with improvised explosive devices, I again said no. Still, he recommended me for disability. The reason: hearing loss. I had passed my audiogram but, according to the doctor, that didn’t matter. Someday, I’d likely need hearing aids, he said, and the government had to budget for that. “You loaned society your body,” he said. “It’s our obligation to return it to you with interest.”

Late last year another new respiratory virus invaded the human population, and the reality of a pandemic is now upon us. Although clearly a serious threat to human health, it does not appear to be as deadly as the 1918 influenza pandemic.

"The priority of the US in the country should be to avoid a humanitarian disaster, not sending naval destroyers.txt","With last week’s significant deployment of United States naval assets in the Caribbean, the Trump administration upped the ante in its confrontation with the Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.

The pandemic has put psychological theories of politics to a very interesting test..txt,"Over the past two decades, as conservatives and liberals have drifted ever farther from each other, an influential body of literature has attempted to psychologize the partisan divide — to identify conservative and liberal personality types, right-wing or left-wing minds or brains, and to vindicate the claim of the noted political scientists Gilbert and Sullivan, That every boy and every gal / That’s born into the world alive. / Is either a little Liberal / Or else a little Conservative.

Legal scholars and a group called the Transition Integrity Project have been examining the ways in which the machinery could fail, and the nightmare scenarios gamed out are hair-raising. But while looking at points of possible legal failure is a useful exercise, it neglects an important question: Who has the power to concede?

Punitive responses will just burden those who have already been hit hard by the coronavirus.txt,"This month, Philadelphia transit police officers violently forced a man off a bus for not wearing a mask.

And where was, and is, S.V.R., Russia’s counterpart to the C.I.A.? The internal competition between Russian spy agencies is fierce, and S.V.R., a potent and storied foreign intelligence agency, is widely recognized as more competent, and stealthier, than Russia’s bumbling military spy agency, G.R.U.

A memorial makes a statement about who is worth preserving Why not a sacred and beautiful nothingness.txt,"In Rome’s Palatine Museum, built atop the excavation site of Emperor Domitian’s palace and not far from imperial residences of Tiberius and Augustus, there is a curious bit of masonry that was rediscovered in 1820. This artifact is exhibited alongside terra cotta heads of Jupiter and marble sculptures of Apollo, all of the grand detritus of a lost civilization housed in a former monastery. At the corner of one of the museum’s galleries sits this short altar chiseled from granite that’s slightly worn from the elements and framed with a modest curled design where a statue might sit. No idol is framed by the base; no statue of strong Jupiter or beautiful Apollo sits atop the altar. It is rather simply dedicated to Agnostos Theos — the “Unknown God.” Where a deity would normally be present is rather a sacred and beautiful nothingness.

And the West’s striking incapacity to support civil society in Belarus screams of 1989 — though not in Eastern Europe but in China. The question of the moment is whether Mr. Lukashenko will repeat the tragedy of Tiananmen.

They’re making it harder for the city to recover Here’s how to lower them.txt,"What’s getting in the way of a recovery for New York City’s small businesses?

Have you been to the edge of the universe?” In the Old Testament, The Voice from the Whirlwind poses these questions to Job. The implied answer is no, for these seem to be divine prerogatives. For humans, heaven is a gated community, and we typically can’t even peer through. This is one reason (among many) near-death experiences inspire awe: They seem to give us a “God’s eye” view of what really lies beyond. They take us to the edge of the universe.

It’s smaller and shorter, operating on a scale of weeks, not months. Until spring, those with jobless benefits will get an extra $300 per week; the long-term unemployed will get extra weeks of benefits; and eligibility for benefits will remain broadened. Several other key programs will be extended for weeks as well. Yet even with these extensions, because of Congress’s long holdup in passing the package it could take several weeks to reinstate lapsed benefits, which will leave many beneficiaries still struggling with January rent and bills.

“Ultra-Orthodox” is a label that should be retired..txt,"In the spring of 2016, President Barack Obama signed a bill eliminating dated references to racial or ethnic minorities that had remained in parts of federal regulations. “Negro” would be replaced with “African-American,” “Oriental” with “Asian-American or Pacific Islander” and so on.

"With a different leader, the United States could have contained the coronavirus.txt","As I watched the first Trump-Biden debate, a vision popped into my head. I imagined that the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party had also gathered to watch the debate — but its members decided to make it more entertaining by playing a drinking game.

Please don’t leave us!” Another neighbor on the second floor, a middle-aged Ecuadorean man who lived with his elderly mother, died the day before Easter.

The person is told to go up and get the bicycle. But it’s only a drawing, he says. He is told that if he doesn’t bring the bicycle down the stairs, he will be beaten. And when, again, he appeals to his torturer’s reason, to the reality in which both the staircase and the bicycle are drawings, he is hit. At this moment he understands that he has been left alone in a reality he believed was shared. He has been abandoned there, while the others have departed to a new reality in which a person can be tortured for being unable to do what is asked because it is physically impossible.

So far, states and localities have responded by slashing spending and jobs, with 1.5 million public-sector workers laid off by the end of June.

"The president’s invoking of the Defense Production Act could transform American life after the coronavirus, if we get it right..txt","The United States can and should “go big” to fight the coronavirus. It has done so before, at extraordinary speed and scale. It has tools like the Defense Production Act to help do it again. And it can be transformative: The industrial mobilization during World War II had a military purpose but lasting economic and social effects, helping build the foundation for a remarkable era of postwar prosperity. To get it right, we must understand how it worked, where it fell short and what the nation needs to mobilize again.

"
Millions of Black women and their political labor have made this historic moment possible.txt,"It will be tempting for some to see Senator Kamala Harris of California’s place on the Democratic presidential ticket as a result of her race and gender, and to characterize it as an affirmative action selection.

In the days since, the state has reverberated with political turmoil. Even the president rebuked Mr. Kemp for moving too fast.

It is the most challenged statute in modern American history. In addition to the Supreme Court cases, there have been more than 1,700 cases in the lower courts; Republicans in Congress have tried more than 70 times to repeal it; the Trump administration has engaged in an unprecedented array of executive actions to undermine the insurance markets and financially starve the law; red states rebelled against it from the day it was passed; and state initiatives have been enacted by supporters to force states to effectuate it.

"
"Right now, it’s not the Republicans But a Hispanic swing toward Trump hints at a more unsettled future.txt","Donald Trump’s coalition in 2016 was an archaism, a throwback — the last gasp of a fading white America, a last dance with the voting blocs that once delivered Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan their landslides, a resentment-soaked attempt to maintain the power that white Christians once took for granted even as its demographic basis slips away. The Democratic Party’s coalition, on the other hand, looks like the American future — a Californian kaleidoscope of diversity, a multiethnic majority that only voter suppression and the rural bias of the Senate can keep at bay.

"As national security adviser, he voiced strong opinions and acted on them, especially when it came to Beijing and Moscow.txt","It became known in foreign policy circles as “the Scowcroft model.” Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser for Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W.

"There is a place for education in the fight against racism, but we shouldn’t confuse it for the fight itself.txt","In the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the season of protests for equality and against police violence that followed, universities are seeking to affirm and reaffirm their commitments to racial justice at all levels. Administrators are drawing up institutional plans to address structural racism (my employer, Arizona State University, put out its own this fall), and faculty are reorienting their courses to greater emphasize diversity and inclusion.

Millions tuned in online, nostalgic for the ballast of his familiar cadence. Many huddled at home as a global pandemic — one that in 2014 he warned could arrive — wreaks havoc, taking lives and evaporating livelihoods. The endorsement had the air of a warm-up; an act one, scene one in the effort to “make the case for Biden that Biden has had trouble making himself,” as Politico recently put it.

I later learned that we only had 25 protective gowns — likewise designed to be single-use items — for an office of nine medical specialists. When I saw a delivery of protective medical equipment in our building the next day, I assumed it was for my office. Instead it was going to the lawyers’ office down the hall.

A mix of dread and hope Of reopening and distancing Of living in two worlds at once.txt,"You may remember the chilling warning from Italian journalists and doctors in early March: The United States is two weeks behind where we are. The message was disorienting — a dispatch from a dystopian future, delivered in the present. The evidence in Italy was undeniable and yet in an America before lockdowns, their crisis was, for many, an abstraction. Even medical professionals preparing for the worst in America seemed to struggle to hold the coming devastation in their minds. “We are starting to see some cases in our hospitals, but it’s nothing like what doctors in Italy are describing,” New York City E.R. doctor Helen Ouyang wrote in a diary during the second week of March. “They warn me that we are about two weeks behind them. Could we really get to where they are in such a short time?”

After the university sent students home because of the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Lee grew frustrated with what she said is expensive and data-restricted internet service in Sanders, an unincorporated village of fewer than 1,000 people in eastern Arizona. Relying on her smartphone data plan wasn’t much of an alternative. “It took one or two hours to watch a 20-minute lecture,” she said. “I just got so frustrated, I figured there had to be another way.” So she made the 40-mile trek several times each week — and she’ll likely have to keep doing it now that the school has canceled nearly all in-person classes for the fall.

The vast amount of demographic information it gathers determines who gets how much political power in Congress and the states; it steers more than a trillion dollars in federal funding for health care and other critical services; it guides long-term economic decisions by governments, corporations and mom-and-pop stores; it helps determine the location of highways and schools, hospitals and housing, police and fire stations.

No national address; no moment of silence or official recognition beyond the occasional tweet and the flying of flags at half-staff over the Memorial Day weekend.

A female vice president would be tasked with wielding power in the service of a more powerful man That’s no challenge to the patriarchy.txt,"For those of us who believe that a female president is long overdue, the past few years have been bitterly disappointing. From Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election to the failure of the Democratic Party to choose a female candidate this year despite an abundance of qualified women, it’s been one setback after another.

A bill that awaits Governor Cuomo’s signature would bolster freedom of speech in the state.txt,"Among the more obnoxious ways the rich and powerful can intimidate and silence critics is filing what is known as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or SLAPP, whose goal is not to pursue a legitimate grievance but to harass and bankrupt opponents.

An economist by training, Dr. Shapiro emphasized the importance of increasing the university’s endowment, which then totaled $115 million.

The suspension of federal benefits would create damage almost as terrifying as the economic effects of the coronavirus.txt,"One pretty good forecasting rule for the coronavirus era has been to take whatever Trump administration officials are saying and assume that the opposite will happen. When President Trump declared in February that the number of cases would soon go close to zero, you knew that a huge pandemic was coming.

The president-elect won promising conciliation His choice of Xavier Becerra to run Health and Human Services promises culture war.txt,"In many ways Joe Biden will enter the presidency in a politically enviable position. The arrival of the coronavirus vaccine means that, after running as the candidate of normalcy, he is poised to preside over its literal return, which could include not just economic recovery but also a period of personal exuberance — at last, restaurants! amusement parks! vacations! — that will feel much more euphoric than the post-financial-crisis grind did under Barack Obama 12 years ago.

A sitting commander in chief used to call on predecessors to provide a sense of national unity Not this one.txt,"About a year ago, in an interview in the Oval Office, I asked President Trump if his years behind the storied Resolute desk had made him empathize with his predecessors.

Despite a tumultuous first two decades of the century, much of our connected way of life has evaded the stress of a singular global event. The possibility of a global pandemic currently posed by the new coronavirus threatens to change that altogether. Should the virus reach extreme levels of infection globally, it would very likely be the first true test of the 21st-century way of life, laying bare the hidden fragility of a system that has long felt seamless.

The illiberal left is a lot less threatening than the right That doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.txt,"An acquaintance came to me a few weeks ago with the rough draft of a letter about free speech and asked me to sign.

Goodbye to an honest man’s campaign.txt,"Bernie Sanders has ended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, which is a tragedy, because he was right about virtually everything. He was right from the very beginning, when he advocated a total overhaul of the American health care system in the 1970s. He remains right now, as a pandemic stresses the meager resources of millions of citizens to their breaking point, and possibly to their death. He was right when he seemed to be the only alarmist in a political climate of complacency. He is right now that he’s the only politician unsurprised to see drug companies profiteering from a lethal plague with Congress’s help. In politics, as in life, being right isn’t necessarily rewarded. But at least there’s some dignity in it.

Johnston, it was on a spring evening, about a month before he would be erased from existence by a gigantic cloud of volcanic ash boiling over him at 300 miles per hour. He was coming through the door of a makeshift command center in Vancouver, Wash., the closest city to the graceful snow-capped dome of Mount St. Helens, a volcano that had been dormant for 123 years. This was April 1980, and Mr. Johnston, a 30-year-old geologist, was one of the first scientists summoned to monitor new warning signs from the mountain — shallow earthquakes and periodic bursts of ash and steam.

The suspended time of the pandemic has put history on fast-forward.txt,"There is something peculiar about time during the pandemic. On the one hand there’s a feeling that the normal calendar has simply stopped, school schedules and sports seasons evaporating, one homebound day passing much like another.

About two out of every five dollars these schools provided in institutional aid went to students the government deemed able to afford college without need-based aid. The schools do it because well-to-do families, overall, bring the institutions more tuition dollars than their lower income peers.

Repayment seemed like a vague, distant concept in large part because I could not fathom being able to repay such staggering amounts of money.

The Democratic presidential candidate’s alleged comments about his employees are part of a legacy of societal resentment toward women for having children..txt,"On the Nevada debate stage last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren flayed the billionaire Michael Bloomberg for Trumpish reviews of women’s looks.

In a 1998 lawsuit, a former employee alleged that Mr. Bloomberg had demanded, “What the hell did you do a thing like that for?” of a newly pregnant employee. The suit also says he cruelly dismissed another employee’s difficulty finding child care, saying of an infant: “It doesn’t know the difference between you and anyone else!

Americans may be finding some common sense about building homes in vulnerable areas.txt,"During the increasingly common ecological disasters that visit this country, there inevitably arises the hope that Americans and their elected politicians will learn from the experience, adopt new policies and provide for a less destructive future. We are now in such a period, with two unfolding climate-fueled disasters occurring at once: Savage wildfires in the West that have consumed more than five million acres of forests and scrublands and taken multiple lives in four states, and a Category 2 hurricane that has brought dangerous flooding and widespread damage to the Florida Panhandle. 
"
And Democrats can easily show that the president has done little to help it..txt,"Every few days, fresh economic statistics roll out, each one almost invariably reinforcing the perception of a solid economy.

Technology offers simple ways to help approximate the experience of being with others..txt,"As a self-employed writer, I often work at home, and have done so for years. This can be great — 10-second commute! writing in pajamas! — but comes with its own challenges. Some people get distracted and spend the day washing dishes, watering plants, organizing socks. Others suffer from having no one to report to. My personal demon is loneliness. After a day of struggling with a book chapter, a process that can feel like mud-wrestling a giant squid, the lack of company can leave me awfully bleak. That’s why I joined a virtual co-working group. 
"
The world’s second-largest economy is coming to a near standstill..txt,"The rapid spread of the coronavirus is a tough blow for a world economy that seemed on the cusp of a modest revival.

America’s failure to deal with the white power movement.txt,"When asked to condemn “white supremacists and militia groups” during his debate with Joe Biden this week, President Trump gave a largely garbled answer, asking for definitions and caveats, attempting to misdirect attention to leftist violence, and repeatedly interrupting the moderator.

The solutions to combating the coronavirus are no mystery It’s time to do this right.txt,"Six to eight weeks. That’s how long some of the nation’s leading public health experts say it would take to finally get the United States’ coronavirus epidemic under control.

No other developed country is doing so badly.txt,"Graphs of the coronavirus curves in Britain, Canada, Germany and Italy look like mountains, with steep climbs up and then back down.

The US should emulate the French government’s resolve to fight for the news media industry.txt,"Much of the news business is being hammered by the decline in advertising because of Covid-19, just when the public most needs reliable information.

"
Learning what hardship has to teach us.txt,"Over the past decades, a tide of “safetyism” has crept over American society. As Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt put it in their book “The Coddling of the American Mind,” this is the mentality that whatever doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The goal is to eliminate any stress or hardship a child might encounter, so he or she won’t be wounded by it.

Allegations of bounties paid for the deaths of US soldiers are serious But the White House ought to stay the course toward a peace deal.txt,"There’s a lot still missing from the reports that Russia paid for attacks on American and other coalition forces in Afghanistan.

"As America retreats from world affairs, Russia is promising other nations help on the pandemic.txt","Before regulators held their ground earlier this month, there were good reasons to be concerned about President Trump’s push for a coronavirus vaccine. But he had already missed becoming the first world leader to get one approved. Vladimir Putin of Russia had already done it.

Conversations on the platform stretch our understanding of the politics of the possible.txt,"In February, I declared, somewhat winkingly, that Twitter is real life. My argument was not that what happens on that social media website is broadly representative of popular opinion but that what happens on Twitter is a good barometer of enthusiasm around movement-building and fandoms.

How many people will die because we’ve been working on the brink of collapse for too long.txt,"LONDON — Ten days ago, I was asked to see a patient. I’m a respiratory specialist in an intensive-care unit at a hospital in London, so it wasn’t surprising that the patient needed a ventilator. It seemed fairly typical.

Critics say we shouldn’t abandon the ideal of an open internet But there is such a thing as being a sucker.txt,"The United States government does not usually block or censor lawful websites, foreign or domestic, because it subscribes to the idea that the internet was designed to be open and connect everyone on earth.

Alarmist is not a word anyone has ever used to describe me before. But this is different..txt,"I’ve had hard conversations this week. “Look me in the eye,” I said to my neighbor Karen, who was spiraling to a dark place in her mind. “I make this personal promise to you — I will not let your children die from this disease.” I swallowed back a lump in my throat. Just the image of one of our kids attached to a tube was jarring. Two weeks ago our kids were having a pizza party and watching cartoons together, running back and forth between our apartments. This was before #socialdistancing was trending. Statistically, I still feel good about my promise to Karen because children do not seem to be dying from Covid-19. There are others to whom I cannot make similar promises.

It is time to rename bases for American heroes — not racist traitors.txt,"The white supremacist who murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., five years ago dispensed with the fiction that the Confederate battle flag was an innocuous symbol of “Southern pride.” A murderer’s manifesto describing the killings as the start of a race war — combined with photos of the killer brandishing a pistol and a rebel flag — made it impossible to ignore the connection between Confederate ideology and a blood-drenched tradition of racial terrorism that dates back to the mid-19th century in the American South.

How the pandemic is changing our understanding of mortality.txt,"This year has awakened us to the fact that we die. We’ve always known it to be true in a technical sense, but a pandemic demands that we internalize this understanding.

To do this means to imagine it, reckon with it and, most important, personalize it. Your life. Your death.

Humans will do figure eights to make facts suit their fictions Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity help the faithful do that.txt,"Back in the 1950s, the psychologist Leon Festinger came up with cognitive dissonance theory, which can essentially be described as the very human desire to reconcile the irreconcilable.

The historian Allan Lichtman was the lonely forecaster who predicted Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 — and also prophesied the president would be impeached. That’s two for two. But Professor Lichtman’s record goes much deeper. In 1980, he developed a presidential prediction model that retrospectively accounted for 120 years of U.S. election history.

It was also, in the autumn of 2004, the estimated casualty rate of killed or wounded for my platoon as we prepared for the assault into Falluja, the largest battle of the Iraq war. Then, “70 percent” was like a code word for my fears. Fear is a virus, too, spreading person to person.

"With relatively low virus rates, the city faces a dilemma over a return to in-person instruction.txt","SAN FRANCISCO — When the coronavirus came here in March, local leaders seemed to do things right. They issued the nation’s first shelter in place order, promptly shut down schools and businesses and made masks routine. It worked: The city has experienced some of the lowest test positivity rates in the country.Now, city officials are forging ahead with a tentative school reopening plan hatched earlier this month, and it couldn’t have come at a worse time. The coronavirus has entered a frightening new stage nationwide — triggering school districts around the country to shutter, including in New York City and the entire state of Kentucky — and putting San Francisco on the horns of a dilemma.The district’s goal of opening some schools could bring relief to thousands of parents and students, but their plan was written for another reality. Virus rates are suddenly spiking, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday to issue a nighttime curfew affecting nearly every county in the state, though San Francisco is below the threshold. As a result, officials here face pushback from some unions, teachers and parents.Whether San Francisco ultimately proceeds can be a bellwether: If schools cannot reopen here where virus rates remain comparatively low, what hope do other cities have for a return to something resembling normalcy?There is mounting evidence that prolonged distance learning could have long-term effects on schoolchildren and their families, including higher dropout rates and lower income in later years. Parents and caretakers have suffered, too, as homebound schooling has caused many to alter their work lives, disproportionately affecting women, minorities and the underprivileged.

The Nazarios are refugees; their remnants have scattered around the world to survive. My Jewish mother fled Poland in 1933. My Christian father fled Syria two years earlier.

The Supreme Court was never meant to be the only arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution.txt,"Beyond the obvious — that liberals need some way to respond to President Trump as he moves to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg — what does it mean that mainstream Democrats are considering once unthinkable ideas like adding seats to the court?

The hit cartoon series has helped me process my biracial identity..txt,"For most of my life, Taiwan was a place that lived in my head.

"
How feminists got stuck answering for a canard.txt,"Joe Biden has been accused of sexual assault, and conservatives are having a field day, exultant that they’ve caught feminists in a new hypocrisy trap. A woman, with no corroboration beyond contemporaneous accounts, charges a powerful man with a decades-old crime? Hmm, doesn’t that sound mighty close to Christine Blasey Ford’s complaint against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh? Yet this time, many liberals who’ve championed the #MeToo movement seem skeptical?

It was unseasonably hot, even for Middle Tennessee, with rain predicted, and earlier protests here had ended in violence, with the Metro Nashville Courthouse and City Hall in flames. Collectively, these are not the most promising conditions for gathering a big crowd, much less a calm one. But the teenagers were determined to press on, even if hardly anyone showed up.

"
Resistance to eliminating it has long been connected to the idea of white supremacy.txt,"As our revived national conversation on race has made clear, the legacies of slavery and white supremacy run wide and deep in American society and political life. One such legacy — which is particularly noteworthy in a presidential election season — has been the survival and preservation of the Electoral College, an institution that has been under fire for more than 200 years. Our complicated method of electing presidents has been the target of recurrent reform attempts since the early 19th century, and the politics of race and region have figured prominently in their defeat.

What’s more, unlike the rare, lengthy vacancies of previous administrations (usually a result of failed nominees), President Trump hasn’t sent a single name to the Republican-controlled Senate since April 10, 2019.

The president — and Congress — should stop outsourcing the defense of the Constitution to judges.txt,"When President Trump introduced Judge Amy Coney Barrett as his third nominee to the Supreme Court, he praised her “unyielding loyalty to the Constitution.” The implicit premise was that her fidelity to the nation’s founding document as a judge could excuse his violations of the Constitution as president. But the highest test of politicians’ constitutional scruples is not how they populate another branch of government. It is how they carry out their responsibilities in their own spheres.

Why a conservative initiative on public architecture might be good for American institutions..txt,"Here are two scenes from the same drama. The first scene takes place in California, where the state’s public university system now effectively requires prospective faculty members to make a statement affirming their commitment to “diversity, equity and inclusion” — an officially politically neutral trinity that is widely suspected to be conterminous with progressive notions of what counts as diversity and what sort of inclusion matters. 
"
He will be a leader for all Americans.txt,"Americans might not need to read a newspaper article to tell them how to vote in this presidential election. In fact, more than four million people have already cast their ballots. The grim reality of American life at this moment — the hundreds of thousands of coronavirus deaths, the financial struggles, the disinformation, the factionalism, the warming planet — makes the case for Joe Biden far more powerfully than any endorsement ever could. For many, the choice is as plain as the mask on Mr. Biden’s face.

We should expect some people to experience side effects The shot is still safer than the disease.txt,"At this point, most of us have heard about allergic reactions to Covid-19 vaccines: the doctor in Boston who had to administer his EpiPen, the hospital worker in Alaska who had trouble breathing. But it’s not at all surprising that allergic reactions happen. What matters most is the severity and the rate at which they occur. And for the Covid vaccines, there’s no doubt that the value of vaccination outweighs the risk.

Ukraine’s president looks back at what got him through his first year in office.txt,"KYIV, Ukraine — Last year on May 20, I was surrounded by crowds of people shaking hands, high-fiving and leaning in for selfies as they gathered to watch my inauguration.

A future without chats in the office kitchen seems pretty lonely.txt,"At the beginning, back in March, the surrealness of daily life was enough to distract from the loneliness. Working from home involuntarily, seeing my newsroom colleagues’ and neighbors’ faces pop up on Zoom — a medium once reserved for long-distance or international communication — felt, above all else, eerie and bizarre. “Just wild,” we all said to one another, with a mix of awe and anxiety.

From May through August, 15 cities banned chokeholds. A dozen passed “duty-to-intervene” statutes, requiring police officers to act if they see a fellow officer endanger a civilian. Still others banned so-called “no knock” warrants or changed policies related to the use of force. 
"
Liberty doesn’t mean freedom to infect other people.txt,"A long time ago, in an America far, far away — actually just last spring — many conservatives dismissed Covid-19 as a New York problem. It’s true that in the first few months of the pandemic, the New York area, the port of entry for many infected visitors from Europe, was hit very hard. But the focus on New York also played into right-wing “American carnage” narratives about the evils of densely populated, diverse cities. Rural white states imagined themselves immune.

What’s bad for America is sometimes good for the market.txt,"The economic news has been terrible. Never mind Wednesday’s G.D.P. report for the first quarter. An economy contracting at an annual rate of almost 5 percent would have been considered very bad in normal times, but this report only captured the first few drops of a torrential downpour. More timely data show an economy falling off a cliff. The Congressional Budget Office is projecting an unemployment rate of 16 percent later this year, and that may well be an underestimate.

"Tackling the pandemic will require a new, collective way of thinking about public health and society as a whole..txt","In 1941, with war tearing through Europe and Asia, and America on the precipice of joining the conflict, President Franklin D. Roosevelt compelled and inspired industries and individuals to rally for the greater good. Food was rationed without rioting, and car plants all but stopped producing automobiles in favor of tanks and fuselages.

"I know if I want to land more roles, I need to look white.txt","Actors of color trying to make it in Hollywood face a paradox: To succeed, you need to stand out from the crowd while assimilating as much as possible. Be yourself while fitting in. And if you aspire to be like one of those leading men you grew up watching on TV, well, you better look the part. Step 1: Calm those curls.

In addition to raging anti-Semitism, the killer had a more immediate motive: fury that the synagogue had participated in the National Refugee Shabbat, sponsored by the humanitarian group HIAS, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. 
"
But history has a way of confounding those who think they can control it.txt,"Over the last few years, the Trump administration has fought to shape the 2020 census to its political benefit and the benefit of the Republican Party. In 2018, it sought to introduce a citizenship question on the census itself, to reduce response rates among immigrant communities. Then, after that was rebuffed by the Supreme Court, it tried to exclude unauthorized immigrants altogether, in direct conflict with the Constitution, which calls on Congress to count “the whole number of persons in each State.” Now it wants to cut the census short and deliver it uncompleted — a last-ditch effort to rig the nation’s politics for the sake of its exclusionary political vision.

Resuming classroom instruction is crucial Infection control inside and outside classrooms can let it happen.txt,"The way states lifted social distancing restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus sadly demonstrates our priorities.

Greek Peak is an economic powerhouse in central New York. Those layoffs have enormous ripples. 
"
It’s a massive bet that political polarization is a more powerful force than the virus’s body count..txt,"Donald Trump’s re-election strategy had two potential paths this week. The first path would save millions of jobs, turn Trump into a populist hero for many and perhaps prevent another depression. The second path would court chaos, playing up the partisan divide, deflecting all blame for the coronavirus pandemic onto the media, China and the Obama White House, and praying that it ends up being enough to obscure his administration’s disastrous lack of preparation.

We need a political system that mirrors the best in us.txt,"In the last Democratic debate, Joe Biden declared that he would nominate a woman as his vice-presidential running mate. That felt right at the time. But times have changed. Biden needs to go much, much further: At the Democratic convention he needs to name not just his vice president, but his entire cabinet. And it needs to be a totally different kind of cabinet — a national unity cabinet — from Democrats on the Bernie Sanders left to Republicans on the Mitt Romney right. Why?

Do Americans really need the amount of treatment that our health care system is used to providing.txt,"As stay-at-home orders ease and cities reopen for business, many doctors and hospital administrators are calling for a quick return of health care to pre-pandemic levels. For months now, routine care has been postponed. Elective procedures — big moneymakers — were halted so that hospitals could divert resources to treating Covid-19 patients. Routine clinic visits were canceled or replaced by online sessions. This has resulted in grievous financial losses for hospitals and clinics. Medical practices have closed. Hospitals have been forced to furlough employees or cut pay.
