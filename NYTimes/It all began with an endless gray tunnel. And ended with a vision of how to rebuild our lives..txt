I stood on the edge of a tunnel. I could look down it in both directions. It didnâ€™t end, so far as I could tell. It was wide enough for two big trucks to pass abreast. The color was a uniform misty gray. The light never changed. There was never a breeze. There were only two things there. They stood across from my vantage point, near the opposite wall. Both appeared to be packages, though neither had any logo or label. One was a squat cylinder that might have held a half-dozen dinner plates. The other was a tall rectangle about the size of an old-fashioned stereo speaker. They, too, were gray.
