After six months at home, I have no idea what I sound like on the page anymore. I’ve lost my voice to underuse — or that’s what it feels like. I don’t know what I look like either. It’s not that I’m sitting around in my pajamas. I’m getting as dressed as I ever did, even putting on perfume. But without daily immersion in society, my sense of the world’s outside-in gaze on me has attenuated.
