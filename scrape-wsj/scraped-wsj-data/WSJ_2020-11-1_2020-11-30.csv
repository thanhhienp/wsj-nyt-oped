2020/11/01,How Congress Can Get Kids Back to Class,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-congress-can-get-kids-back-to-class-11604266927,"The U.K., France and other European countries are closing businesses in another wave of lock downs, as Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations rise. But unlike in the spring, schools are open. Infections are also surging across the U.S., where in many places in-person classrooms are closed and distance learning has become the norm. But there’s growing evidence schools can open safely, with reasonable precautions and, perhaps soon, regular testing. 
The ABC Science Collaboratives, supported by Duke University researchers, are working with school boards, superintendents, principals, teachers, health departments and the state of North Carolina to share data and best practices among more than 50 districts. The findings so far suggest that spread is limited when cases occur in North Carolina districts that are open for some in-person instruction. 
Six districts that completed their first nine weeks of instruction have seen a total of fewer than 20 secondary infections, where infected children or adults pass on the virus to someone else at school. One large district of nearly 35,000 students and staff had fewer than 100 cases over a nine-week period, only eight secondary infections—and no cases of child-to-adult transmission.
These districts used “hybrid” models, in which children were in class only two days a week to reduce classroom density and allow distancing. Masks were required at all times except meals and water breaks. Even in counties where the prevalence of infection was high, this experience suggests schoolhouse outbreaks can be contained. 
Policy makers should take three steps to support opening schools more widely. First, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Education Department should expand research like the North Carolina project. Questions and concerns remain about how easily children can transmit the virus, and whether outbreaks in schools spread into the broader community. Because many children are asymptomatic, outbreaks can go undetected.
Second, Congress should treat teachers like first responders and fund their protective equipment. Older teachers and those with medical risk factors should be allowed to work remotely. The government should provide teachers N95 masks and offer training on how to fit them.
Third, Congress should provide more funding for testing in schools as a further layer of protection. Schools in poor communities or areas with high spread are most likely to benefit. Many of these districts lack resources to retrofit ventilation systems, and some school buildings may not allow for much distancing. 
Prompt testing for those with symptoms and regular testing for those without can detect cases earlier, helping schools take isolation measures and avoid broad shutdowns. The growing availability of inexpensive antigen tests, similar to rapid flu tests, makes routine testing feasible. These tests can be run by a school nurse or other trained worker and provide results in minutes. Schools will need to consider plans for follow-up testing on possible false positives. 
Regular testing has been used by sports leagues, universities and private schools to help prevent outbreaks. The federal government has begun purchasing and distributing some tests to states for school use, and the Rockefeller Foundation is supporting pilot studies to determine the most effective testing strategies. Executing these steps now will make schools more willing to reopen later this fall and winter as the current surge subsides.
In France, bars and restaurants are closed but schools are open. In many parts of the U.S., schools are closed while bars and restaurants are largely open for business. The priority in the weeks and months ahead should be helping more schools reopen—and stay open—so American children can stop losing out on their education.

2020/11/01,Voters and the Other Supreme Courts,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/voters-and-the-other-supreme-courts-11604266857,"The Supreme Court is on Tuesday’s ballot, literally in some states. Most state high-court judges don’t have lifetime tenure and have to face voters periodically for reconfirmation or re-election. On this week’s ballot are 66 high-court seats in 31 states, including three in North Carolina and two each in Georgia, Michigan and Ohio. Democrats hope to unseat conservatives and gain control of Ohio’s high court for the first time since 1993 and Michigan’s since 2010. 
Most supreme court elections are nominally nonpartisan (North Carolina and Pennsylvania are notable exceptions). But they’re still political. According to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law, $40 million was spent on state supreme-court races in the 2017-18 election cycle. These races are especially important this year because state supreme courts will decide challenges to legislative districts drawn after the 2020 census. In Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a challenge to North Carolina’s Republican-drawn congressional map and held that partisan gerrymandering was a political issue beyond the reach of federal courts. 
Several months later, partisan lower-court judges in North Carolina struck down the same map, holding it violated the state constitution’s mandate that “all elections shall be free.” Republicans redrew the map rather than appeal to the state Supreme Court where Democrats held a 6-1 majority. A map redrawn by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court cost Republicans three seats in 2018. Democrats are favored to pick up two U.S. House seats in North Carolina under its redrawn map.
This September the Pennsylvania court’s Democratic majority also ordered county officials to count mailed-in ballots that arrive up to three days after the election. Ignoring an express statutory deadline, the justices held that potential mail delays disfranchise voters and violate the state constitution’s guarantee of free and equal elections. 
In areas beyond electoral politics, too, state supreme courts often issue sweeping policy pronouncements. Teachers unions have cited state constitutional guarantees of free and equal public education in lawsuits to compel legislatures to give schools more money. Supreme courts in Kansas, Ohio and New Jersey ruled in their favor.
Three-quarters of state constitutions also include anti-Catholic Blaine Amendments, which forbid government funding of religious institutions. The Montana Supreme Court struck down a private school tax-credit program in 2018 merely because some religious schools benefited. The U.S. Supreme Court this summer overruled the Montana decision but declined to rule broadly against Blaine Amendments. 
Unions often ask sympathetic state supreme courts to enact labor-friendly policies. The Illinois Supreme Court in 2015 overturned a major bipartisan pension reform. Two years ago California’s liberal high court established a new legal standard that reclassified many independent contractors as employees. 
Liberal cities like Chicago, Baltimore and San Francisco are also turning to state courts to sue fossil-fuel companies over climate change. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held in American Electric Power v. Connecticut (2011) that the Clean Air Act supersedes “any federal common-law right to seek abatement of carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants.” State common-law claims may proliferate if Democrats take control of more supreme courts.
Conservatives have also sought relief in state courts, but less often. In May, a 4-3 conservative majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. The Michigan Supreme Court last month struck down Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s state-of-emergency declaration, ruling she had appropriated legislative powers.
No wonder liberal groups have spent more than $4 million—three times as much as conservatives—on Michigan Supreme Court races this year. With a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court, liberals will be all the more anxious to win control of state supreme courts.

2020/11/01,Trump Has Torn the Mask Off the Liberal Media,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-has-torn-the-mask-off-the-liberal-media-11604266772,"Why does the media hate Donald Trump so much? There are all kinds of theories, but only one really makes sense: We are a country at odds over the most fundamental principles of ideology, economics, religion, race, culture, morality—even our own history. The media is on one side of that metaphorical war, and President Trump calls it out.
In this dispute the two sides have always been known to the participants, but the media doesn’t identify them publicly. A major part of the mainstream media’s strategy has been to preserve the perception of its neutrality and keep its role as hidden as possible. It has been criticized in the past for its liberal bias—by conservatives. But never by a sitting president with such effectiveness. ( Richard Nixon mostly delegated the job to Vice President Spiro Agnew. ) By treating the media for what it is—a belligerent in the culture war—Mr. Trump has done it irreparable damage.
The media is supposed to be a neutral participant. So, to a lesser extent, are Hollywood and academia. Hollywood’s job is to entertain us. The universities’ job is to educate us. The media’s job is to report the news to us. If there is indeed some kind of philosophical, theological and economic battle being waged for the soul of the country, Americans would certainly want to know if those responsible for filtering information to us are doing so in an objective fashion. 
If people knew for a fact that the media were taking sides, the jig would be up. The media would lose much of its ability to influence the outcome. This is what lies behind the media’s fear and loathing of the president. It wants desperately to advance an agenda, but knows that to do so effectively it needs to be perceived as impartial. In other words, the media cares nothing about reality—only the perception of reality. 
Though the president has repeatedly condemned white supremacy, reporters keep asking if he is willing to do so. Though the Supreme Court confirmed his travel ban wasn’t based on religion, many still refer to it as a “Muslim ban.” And who could forget the evidence-free claims, repeated for more than two years, that the president was colluding with Vladimir Putin, or was himself a Russian agent? For four years, Mr. Trump has shined a piercing light on the media’s bias. He has blown the lid completely off its cover. And despite relentless attempts to discredit and destroy him in response, he has survived and even gained momentum.
In a real sense, the president has defeated the media. No matter what the outcome of this election, the media will never again be able to convince the public that it is objective. Everyone—not only conservatives—now knows where it stands. 
That is the real reason the media hates Trump with a blazing, white-hot intensity.

2020/11/01,Be Afraid of Biden’s Latin America Policy,The Americas,https://www.wsj.com/articles/be-afraid-of-bidens-latin-america-policy-11604266597,"As the U.S. heads to an election for president and key Senate seats on Tuesday, there may be more at stake for Latin America than meets the eye. President Trump’s efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela have been ineffective and a humanitarian crisis looms. It’s tempting to think that things can’t get worse. They can.
Among emails recently released by former Biden family business associate Tony Bobulinski, two Colombian investment opportunities are pitched in a May 2017 draft document prepared for the Chinese energy company CEFC. One unique asset the proposal highlights: Joe Biden’s close relationship with Colombia’s then-President Juan Manuel Santos. 

The investor group wasn’t only name-dropping. It was also hawking a ground-floor opportunity thanks to what it called the Obama-Biden administration’s “pragmatic approach” to Latin America. 
In Colombia that approach boiled down to a decision to overlook crimes against humanity by FARC terrorists and support an amnesty that Mr. Santos sought for the group. Those crimes included the recruitment of child soldiers, most of whom were never released or accounted for. 
In a 2016 referendum Colombians rejected the deal the Santos government made with FARC leaders in Havana. But Mr. Santos, who had pledged to honor the popular will, refused to accept defeat. With full support from the Obama administration, he gave FARC capos not only amnesty but unelected seats in Congress. If Colombia’s democracy can withstand the harm this has done to institutions, the rule of law and domestic peace, it will be a miracle. 
It isn’t alarmist to think that a President Biden would double down on the Obama practice of surrender to the region’s thugs. Nor is it going out on a limb to predict that U.S. policy is likely to tilt further in that direction if Mr. Biden’s health begins to fail and radical elements of the Democrat Party take charge. 
The main beef against Mr. Trump is that he is uncouth. He also loses points for his managed trade agenda, in particular the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and his attacks on Mexico and Canada. His efforts to reduce legal immigration earn him demerits too. His State Department’s refusal to grant asylum to former Colombian Agriculture Minister Andrés Felipe Arias, who was a U.S. ally, and its embrace of power-grabbing Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele reveal a worldview no better than Mr. Obama’s. 
Yet a Biden presidency won’t provide much relief. Democrats helped rescue the North American free-trade relationship but in exchange they demanded increased labor regulation. They remain champions of the “made in America” mentality. On the foreign-policy front, as weak as the Trump State Department has been defending U.S. values, the Democrats’ record suggests a Biden presidency would be worse.
As arsonists and looters destroyed urban America this summer with barely a peep from Democrats, it was hard to see “moderate” Joe as representative of the party. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) seemed to align more closely with what it means to be a Democrat these days, and her extremism goes well beyond domestic affairs. Her February 2019 browbeating of Elliott Abrams —President Trump’s special envoy for Venezuela—at a congressional subcommittee hearing was chilling. 
Venezuela’s military dictatorship will challenge the next administration. Team Trump is expected to continue its strategy of squeezing the Maduro regime via sanctions and looking for ways to win over the military high command. Progress will be difficult as narco-trafficking revenues and gold sales continue to flow into government coffers. Even if Mr. Maduro wants to flee, as rumors suggest, he knows too much and Havana isn’t likely to allow it.
Still Mr. Trump’s maximum-pressure campaign is the best option. Expect Democrats to prefer more talks, almost guaranteeing relief for the bad guys and more repression.
Extremists like Rep. Norma Torres (D., Calif.) backed the show trials held by the U.N.’s International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG. Democrats cheered as CICIG unleashed a reign of terror, arbitrarily jailing many suspects without evidence or due process under the banner of “anticorruption.” Fortunately CICIG’s mandate was not renewed in 2018. But Mr. Biden, who was a CICIG fan, can be counted on to try to resurrect it. 
Mr. Biden has said that he would restore the Obama rapprochement with Cuba. He added that he would “insist” the Cubans “keep the commitments they said they would make when we, in fact, set the policy in place.” 
But on human rights Cuba didn’t give an inch under the Obama thaw. Democracy advocates rightly posit that U.S. investments in ventures owned by the military dictatorship strengthen the regime. That may be a “pragmatic approach” to Cuba in the eyes of Hunter Biden, but hardly one that can be good for U.S. interests or human rights.

2020/11/01,A Halloween When Grown-Ups Wore Masks,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-halloween-when-grown-ups-wore-masks-11604266489,"Brooklyn, N.Y.
Halloween at the Varadarajan household started in heinous fashion. Last year we made a last-gasp dash to the drugstore for a hundredweight of candy to hand out to the hordes who pass by our house in Carroll Gardens, a gentrified former Italian-American redoubt. This year we ordered candy online, to be delivered days in advance. But thieves got to it before we did, whisking the Amazon box from outside our front door, where it had been left while we were out. 
The theft was proof of the end of the civic decency that had reigned in the first months of the Covid era. In March, April and May, it was common to find packages sitting unstolen outside front doors, often for days. Even as the pandemic sickened the people of Brooklyn, it led also to an outbreak of probity: People were surviving off these packages, so to steal them from stoops would have been an enhanced sort of sin. Then, around the middle of the summer, the honesty abated. Signs appeared on stoops and gates: “Beware of Thieves.” We lost a delivery of toilet paper in August. And then, last week, the Halloween candy. 
So my wife made a trek to the drugstore a few hours before dark on Halloween and returned with a sackful of joy: Twix, Kit Kat, Starburst, Reese’s Pieces, Skittles, Nerds, Butterfingers, Twizzlers—an eruption of confectionary intended to impart the mother of all sugar highs to the youth of the parish. 
We’d had concerns that parents wouldn’t let their children out, fueled by a dreary neighborhood initiative, the Halloween Pumpkin Hunt, that would have kids, equipped with maps, look for drawings of pumpkins on the windows of people who’d agreed to take part. (The kids would be rewarded with candy at the end.) Instead, we had the most bracing Halloween in recent memory, with candy-seekers out in greater numbers than I could remember from past years. 
There was, it seemed, a joyous rebellion against Covid-19, with people determined to find ways to distribute candy that were pandemic-safe. PVC pipes had been mounted on many stoop railings, serving as chutes by which sweets could be conveyed right into a trick-or-treater’s bag held up at the lower end. At one house we saw that the occupants had rigged up a slide, down which they cantilevered a string-held toy truck with a piece of candy on its flatbed. Children walked up to the truck at the slide’s bottom and took the sweet on offer. 
My wife and I chose to marvel at, but not emulate, these ingenious devices, opting instead for our usual way: two bowls brimming with candy left on the lowermost step of our stoop. We sat on the topmost step, suitably distanced, chirping “Happy Halloween” to the children who skipped by, some—apparent by that lovely blend of unsteadiness and ambition—trick-or-treating for the first time. There were more handmade costumes this year, evidence of time spent confined at home, and our first prize went to the siblings dressed up as jars of peanut butter and jelly, respectively, right down to the nutritional information etched on their backs. 
It dawned on us that Halloween is a time when many children first get to exercise free choice, often against the wishes of their parents. Is it to be a Twix or a Twizzler, Skittles or Starburst? “Take one,” mom says. I say, “No! Take two!” You could see their little minds whir: Should I listen to mom, or to the man who’s subverting her? Oh, the decisions to be made—and the choices—at this most American festival, invincible even by Covid.

2020/11/01,Handcuffing the Police,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/handcuffing-the-police-11604263833,"American cities are bracing for the possibility of riots after Tuesday’s election. But police in Philadelphia now have fewer tools to restore order after the City Council voted last week to ban the use of tear gas during demonstrations.
Philadelphia’s prohibition passed amid a week of rioting after police shot and killed a 27-year-old black man. As of Friday 58 police officers had sustained injuries, including one whose leg was broken after she was deliberately run over by a truck. The city also reported 443 incidents of looting. Rioters used explosives in an attempt to break into 22 automated-teller machines, and they damaged 18 police and fire vehicles. 
Such scenes of urban anarchy have become depressingly routine, and Americans are on edge. This year has seen a record-breaking number of people seeking to buy guns, and big-city retailers are now installing plywood as a post-election precaution. All of this reflects a lack of confidence that police will be able to protect public safety and private property. 
Despite these concerns, police also face new restrictions on their use of crowd-control weapons in Seattle, Berkeley, Portland, Ore., and other hot spots. Progressives claim such tear-gas bans will help de-escalate violent confrontations between demonstrators and the police. Yet when police are unable to use less-than-lethal tools to disperse riots, they’re more likely to rely on deadly alternatives like guns.
When the police struggle to preserve order, opportunities arise for dangerous confrontations between rioters and civilians trying to protect themselves, their families or their businesses. And if local law enforcement can’t do the job, it also becomes more likely that the federal government will have to invoke the Insurrection Act and call in military troops.

2020/11/01,The Coming Assault on Red States,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-coming-assault-on-red-states-11604263537,"‘I don’t see red states and blue states,” said Joe Biden in the final presidential debate, borrowing a line from Barack Obama. He must not have examined the policies that he and Democrats in Congress are pushing that would do disproportional harm to Republican states, especially in the South, while favoring Democratic states. Let’s examine four policies in particular:
• A $15 national minimum wage. Mr. Biden supports it and House Democrats last year voted to raise the federal minimum in $1.10 annual increments to $15 per hour in 2027 from the existing $7.25 floor. 
Mr. Biden says a federal $15 minimum won’t harm small businesses. But the labor market isn’t national. It varies by state and region based on the dominant industries, labor supply and cost of living. The Labor Department says 21 states plus Puerto Rico had a $7.25 minimum wage as of Sept. 1. Ten of those are Southern states with lower per capita incomes than the Northeast or West Coast. 
Their small businesses would be hurt far more than New York ($11.80 minimum wage) and California ($12), where the state minimum is already headed to $15. Seven blue states and 28 cities have imposed a minimum of $15 or higher that will kick in over the next seven years. 
A new study from the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) estimates the House legislation would result in two million job losses across the U.S. Fewer than 10% of the losses would be in states with a Democratic governor and legislature. Layoffs would be especially heavy in Texas (370,664), Pennsylvania (143,402), Florida (133,328), North Carolina (121,581), Ohio (108,312) and Georgia (106,427). They’d also be high in 16 other states where the minimum wage isn’t set to rise above the current federal floor. 
Labor makes up a smaller share of business operating costs in blue states because rents and utility bills are higher. Businesses in wealthier areas also have more flexibility to raise prices to offset higher labor costs. Most workers on the job for more than a few months earn more than the minimum wage, and a higher minimum discourages businesses from hiring less-experienced workers—or those with criminal backgrounds. 
The EPI study estimates that about 60% of job losses from a $15 federal minimum wage would occur among workers between the ages of 16 and 24. No matter. Liberals want to equalize hiring burdens nationwide so Democratic states aren’t less economically competitive. 
• Banning right to work nationwide. That’s also the logic behind the plan to abolish right-to-work laws in the 27 states that prohibit employers from requiring workers to join unions. Most right-to-work states are in the South and West, though West Virginia, Wisconsin and Michigan joined the club more recently. 
Right-to-work states have added more jobs and population this past decade, though they also tend to impose lower taxes and other burdens. Boeing announced a few weeks ago it would consolidate its 787 Dreamliner assembly in right-to-work South Carolina after shifting some production there a decade or so ago from Washington state to avoid strikes by its machinist union.
States have been able to pass right-to-work laws since Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. Democrats want to repeal that right to help unions in non-right-to-work states. 
• Restoring the state and local tax deduction. The pandemic is accelerating the flight of businesses and high-earners from blue states. By capping the SALT deduction at $10,000, the 2017 tax reform exposed the well-to-do to the full pain of high taxes in blue states. Democrats want to restore the full state-and-local tax (SALT) deduction, albeit with much higher federal tax rates. 
In 2017 California, New York and New Jersey accounted for 40% of SALT deducted, according to IRS data, with only 20% of the country’s population. Texas, Florida, Arizona, South Carolina and Montana accounted for about 20% of the U.S. population and a mere 10% of the SALT deducted. Red states tend to have much lower income and property taxes.
 • Another bailout for state politicians. House Democrats passed the Heroes Act in May that provides $915 billion to state and local governments. Senate Republicans oppose this blowout after the $150 billion in direct aid plus $90 billion for schools, public transit and Medicaid that flowed to state and local governments under the Cares Act in March. 
Democrats will certainly pass another bailout in 2021 if they win the election. This will amount in effect to a red-state subsidy for public-union governance in states like California, Illinois and New York. The Heroes Act would also help blue states by raising the federal Medicaid match by 14 percentage points, and overall bailout funds are mostly allocated based on state population and unemployment.
Democratic states that stayed locked down longer and have higher unemployment have drawn more federal aid. According to our calculations based on Bureau of Economic Analysis data, annualized per capita government transfer receipts in the second quarter after the Cares Act passed were significantly higher in New Jersey ($14,033), Illinois ($9,223), New York ($9,030), California ($8,673), Washington ($8,511) and Oregon ($8,258) than Texas ($6,450), Indiana ($6,085), Tennessee ($5,430), Florida ($5,399), Georgia ($5,353) and Arizona ($5,326).
Mr. Biden is right when he says the government shouldn’t pit states against one another. But he ignores that the national policies Democrats are pushing have the effect of systemically discriminating against red states.

2020/11/01,Twitter’s ‘Living’ Censorship,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitters-living-censorship-11604263210,"When social-media companies sanction political speech they don’t like, they always point to one policy or another that was supposedly violated. The truth is they are often making up the rules as they go. 
Twitter admitted as much Friday when it finally agreed to unlock the New York Post’s account after freezing it on Oct. 14 as punishment for reporting on Hunter Biden’s business dealings that were exposed on his abandoned laptop computer. 
“Our policies are living documents,” the company said in explaining its decision to stop blocking the newspaper. Initially, Twitter said the Post’s Biden story violated a policy against “content obtained without authorization.” That was absurd, as leaks of one kind or another are ubiquitous in modern political reporting.
Once that rationale collapsed, Twitter said it “decided to make changes to the policy,” and stopped preventing users from sharing the Post story. But it maintained that the story still violated the policy in effect at the time the Post tweeted it, so the newspaper’s account would remain locked until the offending tweets were deleted.
CEO Jack Dorsey struggled to explain Twitter’s incoherent position in testimony Wednesday before the Senate Commerce Committee. Two days later the company announced another legalistic change. “Decisions made under policies that are subsequently changed & published can now be appealed if the account at issue is a driver of that change.” Got it? 
The bottom line is that Twitter’s censors buckled under public scrutiny and the Post can tweet again. That’s good news for independent journalism, even if most of the press won’t recognize it. Congratulations to the Post, our sister publication under News Corp ownership, whose editors were slandered by the lords of the progressive press corps for reporting news that others ignored. The Post refused to bend to Twitter’s arbitrary demands to delete its offending tweets and prevailed. 
But the whole embarrassing episode undermines the notion that Twitter is enforcing consistent policies as opposed to trying to control American political debate on the fly. Big Tech companies should either step back from political activism, or else be open about what they are doing. Twitter’s “living” censorship policy seems to reflect whatever progressives can get away with at a given time.

2020/11/01,Bidenomics Failed the First Time,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidenomics-failed-the-first-time-11604257600,"No candidate for president with a legacy of 36 years in the Senate and eight in the West Wing should need an economic projection to tell voters what his policies will do. Like it or not, Joe Biden has a record. To obscure that record, Mr. Biden and his team have turned to rewritten history and, even worse, abstract projections to try to convince voters that the same policies that gave us the weakest recovery since the Great Depression will work miracles now, if we simply double down on taxing, spending and regulating.
Mr. Biden plans to raise taxes by three times as much as President Obama did, increase spending by 2.7 times as much, and regulate the economy at levels never before seen in America. He and his campaign refer constantly to projections by Penn Wharton, Moody’s Analytics, the University of Oxford and Goldman Sachs, which claim that the Biden economic program would produce prosperity. But why would Mr. Biden use models and projections of his souped up rerun of the Obama-Biden program when he has the hard facts of what that program actually achieved?
In early 2010 after the recession had ended, the Obama-Biden administration projected a 3.7% average increase in gross domestic product over the next seven years. The Congressional Budget Office projected 3.3% growth for the same period, while the Federal Reserve predicted growth between 3.5% and 4% through 2014. Instead, growth for the remainder of the Obama-Biden administration tanked to an 80-year low of 2.2% as its policies kicked in. Repeatedly during the 2010-16 recovery, the CBO was forced to slash its projections. GDP in 2016 alone was $1.7 trillion below the 2010 forecast, costing Americans an average of $5,238 that year. As growth faltered, federal revenues fell and debt soared. 
The Obama-Biden administration blamed “secular stagnation,” but when President Trump changed policies the clouds of stagnation lifted. Census data says 2019 median household income hit an all-time high, and grew more than six times as much as average annual growth during seven years of the Obama-era recovery. The poverty rate fell more in the first two years under Mr. Trump than in all seven “recovery years” combined under Obama-Biden. Median earnings for men rose 11% more from 2017 through 2019 under Mr. Trump’s policies than during the previous seven years. Incredibly, earnings for women rose 42% more in 2019 alone than in seven years during the entire Obama-Biden recovery. 
Though the Obama-Biden administration defended its economic agenda, the American people didn’t buy it. Aggregating the results of 554 polls conducted during the recovery, RealClearPolitics found that respondents disapproved of the Obama-Biden economic performance by a margin of 11.4 percentage points. In contrast, respondents before the pandemic approved of Mr. Trump’s performance on the economy by a 17-point margin. Even now, despite the Covid-induced economic shutdown, Mr. Trump’s rating on the economy is still positive. The economy is Mr. Biden’s greatest weakness and Mr. Trump’s greatest strength, so Team Biden continues to tell Americans that their memories are at fault, not Mr. Biden’s policies.
The economist Jason Furman, an architect of the Obama-Biden economy and proponent of Mr. Biden’s agenda, claimed in these pages that Mr. Biden’s tax hikes would be “broadly consistent with the tax systems under the successful economies of Presidents Clinton and Obama.” Successful? GDP growth averaged 3.9% under Mr. Clinton but only 1.6% under Mr. Obama. Real median household income rose $7,658 under Mr. Clinton but less than half that under Mr. Obama. The poverty rate fell 24% under Mr. Clinton but less than 4% under Mr. Obama. 
It isn’t by chance that the recoveries under Presidents Clinton and Obama played out so differently. After Mr. Clinton raised taxes and tried to nationalize health care, voters rejected his policies in 1994 by electing a Republican Congress, and Mr. Clinton changed policies: cutting spending, balancing the budget, reforming welfare, reducing taxes and restraining regulations. Mr. Obama was also checked by voters in 2010, by the election of a Republican House, after he raised taxes, nationalized individual health insurance and smothered the economy in regulation. Yet his administration changed nothing and doubled down on taxes, regulations and debt. Does Mr. Biden’s agenda sound more like the second Clinton term or the Obama-Biden program on steroids?
Mr. Furman claims Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cut had, by 2019, “limited revenues to 16% of gross domestic product. That’s the lowest share in half a century, with the exception of recessions and the following years.” Yet Mr. Furman failed to note that the “following years” he was referring to were the eight years of his own Obama-Biden administration, when revenues averaged only 16.1% of GDP—less than the 16.3% the CBO reported for 2019. As a share of GDP, the 2019 revenues that followed Mr. Trump’s tax cut exceeded the average Obama tax-hike-enhanced revenue levels of 2009-16. How is that possible? Obama-Biden lost more from slower growth than they gained from higher taxes. By embracing tax rates over growth rates, the Obama-Biden administration generated less income for American workers and the government.
How could anyone believe that after a progressive program of tax, spend and regulatory control failed during the Obama-Biden administration, Biden-Harris could succeed with a socialist program of taxes, spending and controls at levels Mr. Obama never dared? Those who vote for Biden-Harris because they want more government—even at the cost of less income and freedom for American families—will get what they are voting for. Those who believe they can have more government and more opportunity and freedom at the same time will be disappointed. Those who vote for Biden-Harris because they hate Donald Trump may end up wondering if it was worth it.
If Biden-Harris-Sanders-Warren-Pelosi-AOC control the White House and Congress, and kill the fossil-fuel industry with the Green New Deal, override state right-to-work laws, pack the Supreme Court, pack the Senate by admitting the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as states, expand the spending blowout and raise marginal tax rates to over 50%, will this still be the same country you were born in or came to seeking refuge and opportunity?

2020/11/01,"Arizona Taxes, Growth, Schools and Future",Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/arizona-taxes-growth-schools-and-future-11604255745,"Your editorial “Tax Raid in Arizona” (Oct. 20) makes a persuasive case for why Arizona’s Proposition 208 would be a disaster for my state’s economy. The cited study by economists Art Laffer, Erwin Antoni and Steve Moore explains why: According to IRS data, since 1992 Arizona has gained more than 201,000 tax returns and almost $12 billion in adjusted gross income (AGI) from California; 65,000 filers and $5 billion in AGI from Illinois; and 37,000 tax returns and $2.3 billion from New York.
If you had to sum up the economic development plan for Arizona over our 108-year history, you can boil it down to one word: growth. Prop. 208 will destroy one of Arizona’s great advantages. If this almost doubling of Arizona’s income-tax rate passes, which as the editorial points out wallops small businesses that constitute about half of the affected filers, our top tax rate would be about double that of neighboring Utah, New Mexico and Colorado and completely uncompetitive with no-income-tax Nevada.
Neighboring states will start eating our lunch as businesses and people continue to flee high-tax California for friendlier tax climates.

The Grand Canyon Institute (GCI) appreciates that your editorial cites our analysis of Prop. 208 in Arizona, which taxes the rich to fund K-12 education. We estimate that about one in 10 (360,000) people are employed at small businesses that will be affected by its marginal tax-rate increase on net income that passes through to owners.
GCI has not taken a position on the measure. As Prop. 208 affects about 30,000 households, Messrs. Laffer, Moore and Antoni’s estimate of a 700,000 person migration effect over 10 years is based on assumptions that we consider dubious at best. The magnitude of their job-loss figures (237,000) is also implausible. Their model incorrectly assumes only taxes affect outcomes.
The Goldwater Institute statement that only 13% will go to teacher pay is incorrect. Fifty percent goes to classroom support—which GCI expects will go slightly to class-size reduction, but primarily to teacher pay. Thirteen percent of the money goes to address the teacher supply problem—new teacher mentoring and scholarships for those going into teaching. 
GCI estimates that, after a bit more than a decade, benefits will have grown to $630 million to $1.3 billion in discounted present value annually due to improvement in student outcomes that occur for students who spend their work careers in Arizona.

2020/11/01,Nationhood: A Better Future for Puerto Rico,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/nationhood-a-better-future-for-puerto-rico-11604255623,"Regarding Jenniffer Gonzalez’s letter “Of Course Puerto Rico Deserves to Be a State” (Oct. 28): Unlike politics in the U.S., Puerto Rican politics are not based on the usual left/right spectrum, but on the centuries-old status issue. Pro-sovereignty groups were persecuted and exiled by the colonial government as well, ingraining a colonial mentality in many Puerto Ricans. Today, Puerto Rican politics is still based on the status issue and rooted in these colonial fears.
In 2020, not only did the Democrats erase statehood from their platform and Republican leaders say no to statehood, but the U.S. Justice Department invalidated the Nov. 3 “statehood yes or no” referendum and stated that even if statehood were to win, it would not lead to statehood. Statehood is not economically viable, as detailed in the 2014 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, but Puerto Ricans and Americans have an opportunity to forge the path to sovereignty and free association.
Free association would offer Puerto Rico a dignified relationship with the U.S., where Puerto Rico would be a U.S. ally and economic strategic partner. Currently, free association is the option with the largest growth of support in Puerto Rico. Together, both sovereignty options garnered almost 39% of the vote in the 2012 plebiscite.
This referendum will show Americans that statehood is not supported by an absolute majority of Puerto Ricans. After 500 years of colonialism, Puerto Ricans deserve freedom and nationhood, not statehood.

It is also true that many secular Israelis resent Haredi Jews for shirking obligatory military service. Haredi failure to comply with the public-health guidelines isn’t completely a sign of rebellion against authority. Many Haredi Jews live in very crowded circumstances. Can there be social distancing when 10 people live in a two-room apartment? Haredi Jews eschew computers and the internet. If schools are closed, the students don’t have the option of taking online classes. And, even if the family has a computer, each child (who is very unlikely to be an only child) wouldn’t be able to get a full day of lessons.

It is also worth noting that I wrote in these very pages that Donald Trump “is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform.

2020/11/01,Digital Voting’s Time Has Come,Inside View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-votings-time-has-come-11604251999,"Cash a check or go through airport security, and you’re asked for a photo ID. Heck, visit most offices in major cities and you need an ID. But when you vote, which we’re constantly reminded is the most important thing you can do, you have only to provide your name and address and sign a dusty book and you’re waved in. At least a human will check you in—with mail-in ballots, signatures are easy to forge.
No one knows how much voter fraud takes place, but it’s not zero. There’s something behind the stories of dead Chicagoans voting and living ones offered cash and a drink at a pub for the right vote. There’s a better way.

Paper ballots should go the way of the abacus. Someday, last week’s Supreme Court orders about when various states can count mail-in ballots will seem quaint. Voting can be modernized easily with off-the-shelf technology.
Years ago, a hedge-fund friend proposed a simple solution: Everyone who shows up to vote has a photo taken and then gives a signature or fingerprint. That data is uploaded securely to the cloud and some rudimentary checks are done. But here’s the trick: After the first use, it would be really hard to show up and vote under an assumed name, because the photos wouldn’t match. No one could vote more than once, because the photo would show if you’ve already voted. You could cheat, but only with your first-ever vote. With even the most rudimentary facial recognition, dead people couldn’t vote.
It’s ingenious, but I said at the time it went too far. Taking photos of citizens would violate their privacy. Some may not want others to know their location. Illegal aliens might get nervous—oh wait, they’re not allowed to vote.
But I think the time has come. The proliferation of smartphones, with either fingerprint sensors or facial-recognition security using 30,000 dots to contour your face (masks off, please), means it’s time to begin the transition to online voting, as long as it’s done right. (I can hear you howling already. Bear with me.)
Technology has always updated how we vote. Paper ballots often gave way to machines with levers and those goofy curtains closing behind you. Now we have voting machines with everything from LCD screens and wheels to full-fledged touch screens.
The photo-before-voting scheme could be shielded from hacks. Using a secure tablet, voters’ personal information would be separated from how they voted. Like the blockchain platforms used for cryptocurrencies, voter data could be sent to several cloud locations and services, so even if one is hacked, the others could be checked to verify the real information.
Soon after perfecting this system, we could dump mail-in ballots and start allowing voting on smartphones, which obviously can take your picture, note your location, and even capture a signature. They could also upload data to three, five or even 500 different cloud servers to deter hacking.
Sure, there would still be ways to cheat: You’ve seen the movies in which someone’s thumb gets cut off to open his phone—the inverse of Iraq’s “I Voted” purple ink. Or someone could coerce votes in a nursing home. But both would be a lot harder than either stealing mail-in ballots or harvesting them door-to-door and adjusting votes to your liking.
Instead of a paper trail, you’d have a digital trail that beats postmarks and hanging chads. Another concern is that the elderly may not be comfortable with smartphones or iPads. That’s easy to get over with a robust user interface (not something any government digital service yet knows how to do). Robinhood made stock trading easy, even fun. Voting should be the same.
Since Covid, we’ve seen a boom in online proctoring for college tests and even bar exams. Many of these use the device’s camera and shut off the test if the taker leaves the screen or if someone appears in the background. Those functions could help secure digital voting and put an end to ballot harvesting. Add GPS and two-step authentication and we could cut down 99% of fraud, so no hacker from Ukraine can vote for your town’s dogcatcher.
More than 80% of voters own smartphones. Soon that may exceed 90%. With online and mobile voting, turnout would almost certainly increase from 2016’s underwhelming 60%. That may scare some who think democracy ought to be more limited, but it’s only the best of many reasons to do this. So please, vote early, but not often.

2020/11/02,"California, the Shoplifting State",Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-the-shoplifting-state-11604361241,"Progressives in California in recent years have strengthened property rights—to other people’s property. Shoplifting has essentially been decriminalized, and retailers that apprehend thieves can be sued. The result: Another Walgreens store in San Francisco, the seventh this year, is closing after its shelves were cleared by looters. 
“All of us knew it was coming,” longtime customer Sebastian Luke told the San Francisco Chronicle. “Whenever we go in there, they always have problems with shoplifters.” 
Mr. Luke has been posting photos of the shoplifting sprees. “I feel sorry for the clerks, they are regularly being verbally assaulted,” he said. “The clerks say there is nothing they can do. They say Walgreens’ policy is to not get involved. They don’t want anyone getting injured or getting sued, so the guys just keep coming in and taking whatever they want.”
Several retailers in the state have been sued by people caught shoplifting who claimed to be victims of racial profiling. Businesses understandably fear bad publicity and hefty payouts that may exceed their losses from the theft. Some large retailers including Goodwill, Walmart and Bloomingdale’s sought to punish shoplifters by requiring them to take a class in “life skills” to avoid a criminal complaint. The San Francisco city attorney then sued the educational company that provided the classes for extortion and false imprisonment. 
In California, in short, trying to protect one’s property can be a criminal offense. Looters, on the other hand, typically go free thanks to a 2014 referendum that turned theft of property valued at less than $950 into a misdemeanor. Police stopped apprehending shoplifters because it wasn’t worth their time as thieves were released.
Larceny exploded after the initiative passed and has cost businesses in the state billions of dollars. Retailers have been pushing a referendum on Tuesday’s ballot (Prop. 20) that would increase the criminal penalties for shoplifting, especially for serial thieves who work with teams, which is now common in San Francisco. 
But look who’s spending to oppose it: Unions and Silicon Valley gentry including billionaire investor Tom Steyer, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the wife of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. As ever, the rich can insulate themselves from social disorder caused by progressive policies. Everyone else can’t.

2020/11/02,Europe’s Covid Hospital Lesson,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-covid-hospital-lesson-11604361293,"Europeans are back under lockdown as another virus surge threatens to overwhelm their hospitals, which even before the pandemic were sick and malnourished. This is a side effect of government-run health care and a warning to the U.S.
More than half of the ICU beds in France and two-thirds in Paris are occupied by Covid patients. “At this stage, we know that whatever we do, nearly 9,000 patients will be in intensive care by mid-November, which is almost the entirety of French capacities,” President Emmanuel Macron explained last week as he ordered a second national lockdown.
Hospitals across Europe are close to their limits. The Netherlands is sending some patients to Germany, but Chancellor Angela Merkel warned last week that “if the tempo of infections stays the same, we will reach the capacity of our health-care system within weeks.”
Some U.S. hospitals are also dealing with a Covid surge, and more could be stretched if it continues through the winter. Field hospitals have been set up in Wisconsin and El Paso. But hospitals in hardest-hit regions currently have far more capacity than those in Europe. 
Covid patients occupy 27% of ICU beds in South Dakota and 38% are still available. Virus patients take up about 40% of hospital beds in El Paso—still less than in Europe’s hot spots. Other areas of Texas that were slammed harder during the summer now have spare capacity. Covid patients occupy only 4% or so of hospital beds in San Antonio, Houston and Austin.
Unlike in Europe, hospitals in U.S. hot spots continue to perform preventive screenings and elective procedures. Delaying these reduces the quality-of-life for non-Covid patients and may lead to more deaths later from untreated diseases. Europe’s problem isn’t merely that Covid hospitalizations are increasing faster than in the U.S. Hospitalizations in the U.S. have increased by a quarter over the past two weeks compared to a doubling in Germany and the United Kingdom. But European hospitals are also straining because they have too few beds.
According to an August study in the Journal of Critical Care, the U.S. has 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 population compared to 29.2 in Germany, 15.9 in Belgium, 11.6 in France, 9.7 in Spain, 6.6 in the U.K. and 6.4 in the Netherlands. Hospitals in Europe’s national health systems operate under global budgets that keep a tight cap on hospital funding.
This results in chronic under-investment and rationed care in normal times with patients having to wait longer for treatments and screenings. Hospitals are lean because they can’t afford to maintain spare beds and staff. Paris hospital workers this month protested that government budget cuts have cut ICU beds by half in the last 10 years.
During Europe’s spring surge, treatment in many countries was rationed, as it often is, by age. Older and frailer patients were denied admission to Italian ICUs. The Sunday Times reported last week that U.K. patients over age 80, and some over 60 with underlying conditions, were left to die. Patients over the age of 80 made up 60% of the U.K.’s deaths, but only 2.5% of those in this age group who were hospitalized received intensive care.
The American left has long idealized Europe’s government-run health care because it’s less costly, but patients pay a high price.

2020/11/02,Another Alliance Trump Didn’t Break,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/another-alliance-trump-didnt-break-11604361129,"Joe Biden has hit Donald Trump, sometimes fairly, for alienating U.S. allies. But one example of a bilateral relationship that has strengthened on Mr. Trump’s watch is with India, as demonstrated by a military intelligence-sharing pact signed last week.
Under the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement, the U.S. will share maps and databases from the Defense Department’s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). That could strengthen India’s defenses against its traditional rival, Pakistan. But more important to the U.S., it will help New Delhi balance Beijing’s bid to dominate Asia.
Indian leaders since the Cold War have been wary of strategic partnerships, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has signed three military cooperation agreements with the U.S. since 2016. Chinese President Xi Jinping can’t be happy, but his actions are accelerating the trend. China has built up its naval presence in the Indian Ocean, defied maritime law in the South China Sea, and pressed territorial claims along India’s northern border, leading to a deadly clash in June. 
U.S. satellite data, the best in the world, can identify Chinese troop movements and guide precision weapons. Many of India’s current weapons are Russian. But this agreement could encourage India to buy more interoperable American and allied systems, especially as Moscow moves closer to Beijing.
American interests in Asia have traditionally focused on Western Pacific countries like Japan and Korea. But in 2018 the U.S. changed the name of its Pacific Command to the Indo-Pacific Command, reflecting South Asia’s strategic significance in competition with Beijing. China has leased land in the Maldives and Sri Lanka and depends on the Malacca Strait, adjacent to the Indian Ocean, for most oil imports.
China’s diplomatic and military actions over the last year have grown increasingly menacing, with its threats against Taiwan perhaps the most acute problem for the next U.S. President. Yet Washington’s closer cooperation with New Delhi shows that, even as Beijing throws its weight around, China is spurring a formidable coalition to resist.

2020/11/02,What Pollsters Miss About Trump,Main Street,https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-pollsters-miss-about-trump-11604360068," Matt Towery thought he’d retired from the polling business. But this election year has him feeling a little like Michael Corleone. Just when he thought he was out, he says, they pulled him back in.
Mr. Towery, a practicing attorney living in Florida, is a former columnist with Creators Syndicate and founder and chairman of InsiderAdvantage, a political news site. If people are eager to hear his take on this election, it’s because in 2016 Mr. Towery was among the very few pollsters who called it for Donald Trump. On this election eve, with most polls and models again predicting all but certain defeat for Mr. Trump, I ask Mr. Towery if he’s still confident the president will pull out another victory.
“I am,” he answers, “and I’m increasingly confident.”

Mr. Towery dismisses polls showing huge leads for Joe Biden because the state races will be tight and their models aren’t that good at “picking up the average guy on the street.” Cellphones have only made it harder to get a good representative sample, especially from young people.
“How many young people do you know who will answer a call from an unknown number on their cellphones and happily spend the next 20 minutes answering questions?” he asks.
Firms such as InsiderAdvantage may be better at responding to this challenge, because they use a mix of techniques to get answers to their polls. He calls these firms “cowboy pollsters,” and says that unlike those who work for the networks and big press outlets, these are generally independent operators based outside New York and Washington. He says the Atlanta-based Trafalgar Group, which also got it right in 2016, is another example of a cowboy pollster. 
In the final days of Mr. Trump’s 2016 run, Mr. Towery wrote a memo outlining why he thought the polling was off, ranging from overweighting for Democratic voters to underweighting for male and white voters. Sean Hannity read it on the air in one of his last radio shows before the election. Most polls, the memo said, “were being weighted based on a conventional turnout in a very unconventional year and there is a ‘Trump vote’ that most pollsters just are not able to capture.”
Its conclusion: “I fully expect Donald Trump to win this election and in a manner that will leave pollsters and pundits stunned.”
Mr. Towery sees similar weaknesses in this year’s polling. Yes, the president has lost support from seniors and women, and while InsiderAdvantage’s last Pennsylvania poll has Mr. Trump ahead, Mr. Towery says the Midwest will be a real battle for the president to hold. But there are other trends he thinks the major polls may be missing.
Start with the black vote. Though he knows Republicans have for years been predicting a swing in the black vote only to be disappointed when it doesn’t come in, he says 14% or 15% for Mr. Trump isn’t impossible this year, which would be up from 8% in 2016. He’s also now seeing a movement toward Mr. Trump from young voters who are tired of being locked up at home because of Covid-19 and see Mr. Biden as the candidate of shutdowns. The momentum, Mr. Towery says, has clearly shifted to the president.
He also holds a contrarian view of the president’s rallies. Unlike media elites and Beltway political observers who dismiss these people and their MAGA hats, Mr. Towery thinks the rallies will pay huge dividends on Election Day. “Trump has an instinct for what a showman needs to show,” he says. He believes the rallies will prove particularly helpful in getting people out in the rural areas where the president needs every last vote.
“Many people are passionate about voting against Trump,” Mr. Towery says. “But the crowds Trump is drawing says there are people who will walk over hot coals to vote for Trump.”
Even those who detest the president must concede his pace has been incredible. In the last three days before the election, Mr. Trump scheduled 14 rallies. Previous Republican presidential candidates who would lose their races— George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, John McCain —looked resigned to the inevitable as they headed into Election Day. Whatever else you can say about him, Donald Trump is leaving it all on the field.
On Sunday John Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, told CNN that “Donald Trump is doing things that have never been done in Pennsylvania politics in terms of the raw barnstorming” across small counties. Mr. Fetterman earlier tweeted a Reuters photo of a huge Trump rally the day before in Butler, Pa., and appended a warning to his fellow Democrats: “The President is popular in PA. I don’t care what the polls say.”
Mr. Towery cheerfully admits he has been wrong before. If he’s wrong this time, he says he’ll ride off into the sunset. But he doesn’t think he’s wrong. “I think the pollsters and pundits who had this a blowout for Biden are not going to be very happy later this week.”

2020/11/02,The World Still Watches America,Global View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-still-watches-america-11604360015,"For the 58th time since George Washington headed to New York for his first inauguration, U.S. voters are choosing the president, and again the eyes of the world are firmly fixed on the spectacle. 
This is partly because American policy still matters. Will Donald Trump or Joe Biden be strong enough to manage a deteriorating U.S.-China relationship—and smart enough to still preserve the elements of cooperation that benefit both parties? What role will the president play in the global recovery from the pandemic? Will he embrace international institutions like the World Trade Organization and agreements like the Paris climate accords, or will he undermine them? How will he deal with rancorous countries like Russia, Turkey and Iran? Will he side with traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East, or will he look for new relationships in an era of shifting geopolitics? Will he open America’s borders to migrants, or will he try to slam them shut? 
Not only U.S. voters care about these issues. So do people around the world whose lives will be directly affected by the choice Americans are making this fall. 

The world’s love-hate relationship with the U.S. is about more than military might and policy ideas. For all the talk about decline and the supposed collapse of American soft power, the U.S. remains the unrivaled diva on the global stage—the most arresting figure, if not always the most sympathetic one, whose antics keep all transfixed.
America is the world’s biggest billboard. Nothing that happens here stays here; everything spreads. If Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality spring up in Minnesota, protesters in Lagos, Nigeria, take note. If U.S. rioters start demolishing Confederate memorials, statues of slave traders go into the river in Britain. And if Americans elect a nationalist populist to the presidency, his rhetoric and his ideas will be repeated and sometimes distorted out to the farthest ends of the earth. For good or for bad, the U.S. matters. 
America is an experiment in self-governance. The U.S. is a “government of the people, by the people, for the people,” as Lincoln put it. No aristocracy, no cultural or technocratic elite, no religious hierarchy ever quite manages to govern Americans. (Though many have tried, and some are still trying.) And no smooth-tongued demagogue has ever persuaded us to dismantle the constitutional fences that protect our inherited institutions. 
Some well-meaning Americans think that our many flaws undermine the power of our example to the world. That is not the whole story. For admirers of liberty around the world, the example of our democracy is all the more compelling because the faults of U.S. society are out in plain view. The history of American democracy is not a story of sages and philosopher kings. The U.S. story is rich with examples of racism, political corruption, hypocrisy and crass materialism. America has left undone things it ought to have done and done things it ought not to have done. Its critics have never lacked for material. 
U.S. history is not a tale of preternaturally virtuous people overcoming temptations that lesser nations cannot resist. If it were, the American example would not be contagious. But if boobs like us can make democracy work, then there is a chance for people to make it work anywhere. 
All countries face the challenges that are stress-testing the U.S. system. The rise of social media and populist skepticism about the wisdom and beneficence of scientific, cultural and financial elites is not limited to America. The U.S. is not the only country that struggles with legacies of slavery, racism and religious divisions. The economic challenges of the information revolution—upending some industries, plunging millions of families into uncertainty and distress, creating powerful new firms and offering unprecedented opportunities to some—aren’t happening only here. And, of course, Covid-19 is not restricted to America. 
More than who wins the U.S. election, the world cares that America makes its system work, despite polarization and immense stress. The success or the failure of the U.S. experiment in self-governance continues to matter, hugely, for billions of people who have never visited America, read the U.S. Constitution or studied American history. If democracy were to fail here, its promise for the rest of the world would be blighted and diminished for generations.
Voting may not seem like the most heroic of tasks, and patiently accepting a disappointing result even less so. But the regular and peaceful performance of these humdrum duties, so long taken for granted in American life, still has the power to electrify the world.

2020/11/02,Georgia May Decide the Senate Majority,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/georgia-may-decide-the-senate-majority-11604359957,"Atlanta
Georgia has the distinction, or the misfortune, of holding two competitive Senate elections on the same day. The normally scheduled election has Sen. David Perdue, a Republican, running for re-election against Democrat Jon Ossoff, a reporter and media entrepreneur. The other is a special election. When Johnny Isakson announced his resignation from the Senate in 2019, Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Kelly Loeffler to the office. State law requires a special election on Nov. 3, in which all candidates from any party appear on the same ballot. There are three main contenders: Sen. Loeffler, a former financial executive; Republican Rep. Doug Collins ; and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. 
Under Georgia’s unusual election laws, a candidate in either race must receive an outright majority to win. Failing that, the two top finishers will face each other in a Jan. 5 runoff. With the GOP vote split, Mr. Warnock, a Democrat, will almost certainly manage a plurality but not a majority. The Ossoff-Perdue race is so close that neither may break 50%. All of which means that when the Senate reconvenes on Jan. 3, at least one of Georgia’s seats will likely be vacant for a couple of days.
Democratic campaign events have mostly been “drive-in rallies.” People listen to speeches on car radios and honk instead of clapping. At a rally for Mr. Warnock in Fort Valley, about half the attendees mingled as if it were an ordinary campaign stop. The almost exclusively African-American crowd was delightful; a gentleman named Gus led me around and introduced me to friends as “Wall Street.” But it was hard to get near the candidate to talk to him—even selfies had to be six feet apart—and I wondered if all the Covid fuss was inhibiting the work of campaigning. 
I did find one traditional event on the Democratic side: Mr. Ossoff, Mr. Warnock and the rapper Common drew a crowd of about 75 to the parking lot of a “plant based” burger joint in Jonesboro called the Slutty Vegan. Campaign advisories stressed the need to wear masks and socially distance, but these directives were haphazardly heeded. All wore masks, or at least wrapped them across their chins like Amish beards, but most people gave up on social distancing. Once Mr. Warnock began to preach—he is a gifted orator—we all squeezed in as tightly as any crowd at a Trump rally.
The name Slutty Vegan nicely captures modern progressivism’s combination of baby-boomer permissiveness and millennial piety: polyamorous marriage but also plastic straw bans. The same discordance shows up in the public-health attitudinizing of Democratic campaigns. If the candidates genuinely believed their party’s alarmism on Covid, they wouldn’t hold public events. Yet they do, for the excellent reason that they want to win. 
As for the GOP candidates, Mr. Collins and Ms. Loeffler have both been on conventional campaign tours, stopping at three or four places a day. No drive-in events for the Republicans. The two have also spent weeks running brutal ads against each other, which could end up dooming both their chances in a run-off election.
Still, conventional wisdom would bet on Ms. Loeffler making the runoff and winning the election. Ms. Loeffler has spent far more on the race than Mr. Collins. She is strikingly attractive and commands the attention of any room she’s in. But she speaks with a kind of placid reserve, as if she doesn’t quite know if she wants the job, and she doesn’t sound remotely Southern (she was born and raised in central Illinois). 
Ms. Loeffler frequently stresses her humble origins. “I grew up on a farm” and “waitressed my way through college,” she told a small audience in Douglasville. After that event I spoke to a local developer, Johnny Blankenship. He had come to hear Ms. Loeffler, he told me, because he hadn’t decided which Republican to vote for. “I like her,” he said, “but I’m not sure she’s”—he searched for the word—“authentic?” 
That is not a criticism you would likely make of Mr. Collins. He is a fast-talking fulminator who—it’s fair to say—is not averse to the sound of his own voice. He speaks with a heavy north Georgia accent and knows how to get a crowd excited. In Cedartown, a small city near the Alabama border, Mr. Collins defended his record on guns so aggressively that a listener exclaimed, “You a shootin’ star, Doug Collins!” I heard no outbursts at Loeffler events. 
The day before, Messrs. Ossoff and Perdue had participated in a public debate. Mr. Ossoff savaged his opponent so badly on an accusation of insider trading while in the Senate that Mr. Perdue pulled out of the third and final debate. The accusation was unfair, but the pull-out made him look weak.
In 2017 Mr. Ossoff, then only 30, lost a special election for the U.S. House, but I suspect he is a savvier politician than his opponent anticipated. Southern Democrats so often lose federal elections because they try too hard to ingratiate themselves with party big-shots in Washington, journalists in New York and wealthy donors in Silicon Valley. These hapless Democrats spend their general elections talking about abortion, transgender rights and climate change, and they get easily trounced by Republicans. Mr. Ossoff appears determined not to make that mistake. 
He speaks in broad terms about voting rights and health care but rarely sounds like a thoroughgoing progressive. At a drive-in rally in Columbus I asked him if he supported the Green New Deal. His one-word response: “No.” I asked him if he would support a move to add justices to the Supreme Court. His answer: “I don’t support adding justices just because you don’t like the judicial philosophy of recently confirmed justices.” It’s a shrewd answer: A lot could turn on the words “just because.” 
Pundits often speak of Georgia turning blue as though it were proof of progressivism’s nascent appeal in the South. But Democratic momentum in Georgia is simply a matter of math: Atlanta is a fast-growing metropolis of six million in a mostly rural state of 10.5 million. Georgia may not go blue in 2020, but it’s getting sluttier and more vegan all the time.

2020/11/02,Democracy Is Tearing Us Apart,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/democracy-is-tearing-us-apart-11604359879,"A good test of your political sanity is to see if you can think of a reason to vote for the other guy. Try it. We all have our preferences. Most of us make up our minds before the campaigns start. But it’s still a worthwhile exercise. If you can’t think of a single reason, ask yourself why. The answer may surprise you. 
Americans live in a big, boisterous, divided nation of red states and blue states, Democratic precincts and Republican strongholds. It can be easy to assume the worst of those who live far away. Miami to Seattle is a 3,300-mile drive. Paris is closer to Moscow than San Diego is to Boston. We used to think that the values that united us were more powerful than the distances that divided us. Do we still?
The plywood boards going up on windows in Democratic cities’ downtown shopping districts suggest we don’t. The expectation that this week’s losing side will take to the streets should inspire a national examination of conscience. We say we are one nation, indivisible. It seems less true that it did 30 years ago.
Perhaps it’s human nature to divide ourselves into teams. The factionalism that Washington warned about in his Farewell Address may be an impulse sharpened by evolution: It’s a jungle out there. There’s strength in numbers. Elections are binary. It’s us or them.
This time around it feels like we’ve ventured a little further into that wild frontier than we should. Presidential historians tell us that elections have often turned nasty, but not in our lifetimes. Not like this. Trump is a racist. Biden is corrupt. Pence is a theocrat. Harris is a socialist. Why would any sane person vote for any of them? It’s a fair question. We might do well to ponder it honestly.
If the fate of the republic is on the ballot every four years, as the polemicists always insist, we may not be as indivisible as advertised. 
I drove this weekend through Westchester County, N.Y., and Fairfield County, Conn. These are some of the richest ZIP Codes in the country. I saw nothing but Biden-Harris and Black Lives Matter signs from Chappaqua to Ridgefield. In the considerably less affluent neighborhoods of the northern Bronx and Yonkers fly a fair number of Trump flags. 
It doesn’t compute. Immigrants for Trump? Rich people for higher taxes? How can it be? Everything is possible in America. 
One thing you can say for sure is that our politics are a mess. Everyone’s trying to make sense of things the best they can. Some vote their pocketbook. Some vote their conscience. Some vote for the candidate. Some vote against him. 
Can you imagine being friends with someone who votes for the other guy? Could you stomach a Thanksgiving dinner at the same table? I fear that, for too many Americans, the answer to these questions is no. 
Elections are about drawing distinctions. Candidates win by convincing voters the other guy is not only wrong but a lowdown, lying, dirty dog. It can’t possibly be true. Not all the time.
Maybe you can’t think of a good reason to vote for the other guy. Maybe you think anyone who votes differently than you deserves to be punished. If so, consider the possibility that you’ve lost sight of what it means to live in a land of liberty and justice for all. 
I know how I’m voting. I have my reasons, just as you certainly have yours. When the counting’s done, let’s see if we can remember what it is we’re supposed to have in common.

2020/11/02,Woke Universities Lead America to a Primitive State,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/woke-universities-lead-america-to-a-primitive-state-11604359918,"In this election season it’s almost impossible to find pro-Trump bumper stickers or signs anywhere in my town. The reason is not lack of support but fear of vandalism, or worse: People nationwide have been physically assaulted and even threatened with loss of their livelihoods for no other reason than that they plan to vote as one half of the country does, and political goals are now commonly pursued by violent means. With this our civilization seems to be regressing to a more primitive stage of its development—a time when disputes were settled by force instead of rules, and before the First Amendment guaranteed the right to speak freely on the social and political issues of the day. 
That’s bad enough in itself, but worse yet is that this social regression began on college campuses, of all places, before spreading to the national culture. On one-party campuses, radical-left faculty have established a political orthodoxy that student mobs enforce, and the political culture of the nation is poisoned as those students take home with them their professors’ habit of seeing opinions that differ from theirs as an evil not to be tolerated.
The left-wing political orthodoxy is also taking the place of traditional civics. Recent graduates know much less about U.S. government than older Americans do. In 2018 the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation gave a sample of Americans a test based on the exam for U.S. citizenship. Only 19% of people under 45 passed, while 74% of those over 65 did, meaning even elderly people who learned the material more than 40 years ago can summon it from memory better than recent grads. Similar studies have found a regression in knowledge of U.S. history. Today’s universities are presiding over a nationwide reversion to civic illiteracy. That’s a disaster for the country, but it suits campus radicals. A well-informed citizenry would hardly wish to be governed by people whose ideological kin have reduced so many countries to economic and political deserts.
America’s universities were once the leading edge of an advanced culture, reinforcing and expanding the country’s best features. They steered differences of opinion away from rancor and toward well-regulated, informed debate. They welcomed eccentric opinions, expanded the boundaries of thought and learning in every sphere, prepared students for citizenship by rooting them in their society’s government and history, and trained students for nonpartisan service in the specialized professions an advanced society needs.
None of that persists today. Far from being the leading edge of an advanced culture, the universities drag America back toward a more primitive state. They have contempt for the restraints and rules that define society, such as political neutrality in nonpolitical institutions. For radicals, politics takes precedence over everything, and every field within social science and the humanities eventually degrades into a mere channel to spread progressive orthodoxies.
In an advanced society, journalists have the vital job of keeping the citizenry well-informed so that the government can be held to account. Only in less-developed cultures is the press commonly under firm political control. But since America’s university journalism programs are now overwhelmingly left-activist, we now effectively have the politicized press of an undeveloped nation. The same holds for schoolteachers, at present also trained by campus radicals, which is making public school systems increasingly ideological. Socialist dictatorships and banana republics hold their universities under strict political control; it’s astonishing that the U.S. seems to be joining that club.
Race relations in America are devolving under the same progressive leadership. Campuses are in a constant state of hysteria about “systemic” racism, with small armies of diversity administrators always eager to jump at the slightest infraction, real or imagined. Why does invisible campus racism need such zealous policing? If radical leftists can persuade enough people that America is rotten at its core with racial prejudice, they’ll gain traction for their program of radical social transformation. Power-hungry radicals whip up racial tensions where none exist because their authority depends on social division.
In the past, universities were indispensable in maintaining American culture, but now they undermine and sicken it. The public should learn to see through the patina of prestige that still covers elite schools, and should assess realistically the damage these schools are doing today. That damage goes beyond a failure to develop graduates who think independently. Universities now attack the most basic principles of American society, and do so with lavish taxpayer support. We should decide how best to cut them off.

In recent Pennsylvania polling, [Republican pollsters] tried this: They asked voters whether they would “likely” or “definitely” vote for Trump or Biden. Later in the survey, they asked voters if they knew anyone who is likely to vote for Trump but too embarrassed to admit it. Then, for the ones who answered yes, they asked, “And would that be you?” If the answer was yes, they checked back to see what that person had said about their intention to vote; if they said they would “definitely” vote for Trump, they were not counted. . . . The ones who remained, about 2.5% to 3% of voters in Pennsylvania, qualified as possible shy Trump voters.

2020/11/02,Ranked-Choice Voting Is Second Best,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/ranked-choice-voting-is-second-best-11604348234,"Electoral reforms often don’t have the results proponents foresee—witness campaign-finance rules that empower wealthy candidates, or “independent” redistricting bodies that also gerrymander. So it is with ranked-choice voting (RCV), an idea that has taken hold in two dozen mostly liberal cities. On Nov. 3, RCV will face its biggest electoral test to date as voters in Alaska and Massachusetts decide whether to adopt it statewide.
As the name implies, ranked-choice voting means voters rank candidates in order of preference. Less intuitive is how this produces a single winner. It works like this: The counting proceeds in a number of “rounds.” In the first round, the candidate who has the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated. For voters who ranked that candidate first, their second choice becomes their first choice. A second round of counting follows, and the candidate with the fewest first choice votes is eliminated again. The process is over when one candidate has a majority of first-place votes.
Got it? It’s confusing. But proponents claim a host of benefits. First, they appeal to moderates by arguing RCV races would be less divisive as the winning candidate would need to have broader appeal. 
They also appeal to more ideological voters—especially on the left—by arguing that they can express their views with more precision in a ranked-choice system. If states used ranked-choice voting in presidential elections, for example, left-wing alternatives like Ralph Nader in 2000 and Jill Stein in 2016 would be less threatening to Democrats. Their votes would presumably have gone to Al Gore and Hillary Clinton in the second round.
No one knows for sure the long-term impact of RCV on federal or state general elections. Maine was the first state to use it at that level in 2018. Democratic challenger Jared Golden trailed the Republican incumbent in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District by 2,000 votes in the initial tally, but won by about 3,000 votes when third and fourth choice candidates were included.
We don’t need empirical evidence to know RCV would make elections more difficult to navigate when trust in democratic institutions is already low. Columbia computer scientist Stephen Unger has highlighted some of the “bizarre outcomes” the iterated counting system delivers. For example, in a three-candidate race, it’s possible that it if all supporters of candidate A listed him first, he would lose in the second round—but if some of them strategically listed him third, he would win, because a different candidate would be knocked out in the first round.
Whether such cases would occur often in practice is less relevant than the effect the complex system would have on voter confidence. For a 2017 paper in the journal Politics and Policy, political scientist Lindsay Nielson had volunteers do mock traditional and ranked-choice elections and surveyed them about the experience. She found “weak support for the supposition that RCV rules could increase support for election winners.” She also found respondents were significantly less likely to say RCV was “fair” than plurality voting.
As for the idea that RCV will moderate politics, San Francisco State University political scientist Jason McDaniel followed mayoral voting patterns in cities that adopted RCV and those that didn’t. RCV led to “greater racial divisions at the ballot box between white and Asian voters, and quite possibly also between white and Black voters,” he wrote in a 2018 paper for the California Journal of Politics and Policy. Faced with a more confusing set of options, voters may be “more likely to rely on candidate traits.”
In a 2019 paper, Mr. McDaniel also found RCV leads to a “significant decrease in voter turnout of approximately 3-5 percentage points in RCV cities.” College-educated progressives may appreciate the chance to list more choices. But for voters who favor one candidate but don’t spend as much time gaming out political possibilities, it is a burden they would rather avoid.
There is research pointing in both directions on RCV, and there may be circumstances where it makes sense—such as within parties in crowded primaries.
But rather than make U.S. politics kinder and gentler, we worry the effect of wider adoption would be to tear at existing divides. Major parties could be weakened to the benefit of more extreme candidates. Pressure groups and the most sophisticated slices of the electorate could increase their dominance. And political legitimacy would suffer at a time we can’t afford it.

2020/11/02,The American Experiment Is Alive and Well,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-american-experiment-is-alive-and-well-11604348109,"Andrew Michta’s “The American Experiment Is on Life Support” (op-ed, Oct. 27) is hyperbolic to the point of absurdity. He magnifies the foolish words and destructive actions of a minuscule, marginal minority on the left to suggest that they represent an existential threat to our very way of life. In the process, he ignores the far greater threat posed by an unaccountable, antidemocratic president. President Trump claims he is all that stands between the good people of America and the forces of Bolshevik chaos, which will surely overwhelm them if a Democrat is elected. What rot! Failing right-wing regimes have fallen back on this canard for over a century to distract from their incompetence. But it won’t work. We are not 1932 Weimar Germany. The republic isn’t under siege by a left-wing mass movement on the precipice of taking power. I am confident that voters will see through the ruse and remove its messenger, and that a responsible new administration will prove Mr. Michta’s (and President Trump’s) argument to be the nonsense it is.
Mark Messenbaugh
Lafayette, Colo.
Mr. Michta is an alarmist. The Covid pandemic has exposed the structural problems that low unemployment numbers and high stock-market prices had helped to hide. Millions of Americans live paycheck to paycheck with little or no reserves to fall back on. In most cases, their health care is inadequate. A large percentage of Americans can more or less hold its own in such an economy, but another large percentage cannot. This situation is untenable. 
We have a disagreement about how America might work best, not a Leninist plot to deconstruct the American experiment. To use an appropriate Lenin quotation for once: “What is to be done?” America is a work in progress and will always be in need of improvement and change. Let’s spend less time talking about American exceptionalism and more time finding constructive ways to solve those obvious problems staring us in the face.
Michael Richards
Purcellville, Va.
One reason the young were never subjected to the foundational American ideal of the American dream, or never believed in it, is because we grew up watching families searching for this American dream, detained at the border, endless wars often killing innocent people in the Middle East and leaders we can’t believe in to represent us. 
Eva Grossman
Temecula, Calif.
Mr. Michta’s diagnosis is correct. It’s unsettling that once-radical perspectives on American history are fast becoming the norm. Yet not everyone in academia imbibes the neo-Marxist theory they’re force-fed. On campus, a small but vocal minority see in the American story an imperfect but fundamentally good project that’s worth defending.
Doing so isn’t easy in universities controlled by the left, but many young people crave the perspectives they don’t get in the classroom. To that end there’s a growing movement of scholars and activists working to provide a corrective to decades of neo-Marxist domination. Instead of deeming higher education a lost cause, we should make sure students grapple with arguments that defend the American ideal rather than denounce it. 
Daniel J. Samet, Ph.D. candidate
University of Texas at Austin
Mr. Michta might have extended his denunciation of American college students and faculty by stating that “their ignorance of history is the hallmark of” most Americans at every period of history. Each generation has its own memory and views history the way it wishes. Arthur Schlesinger Jr. won the Pulitzer Prize in 1946 for “The Age of Jackson,” with one reference to the Cherokee Nation and none to the Trail of Tears. No one was interested in Wounded Knee or the fate of the Native Americans. Recently the Journal ran two superb book reviews on the destruction of America’s Indigenous people as they tried to ward off the U.S. westward expansion. Actually, Mr. Michta’s comments are a “hallmark of the current crisis”: partisan, ill-informed and shrill.

2020/11/02,Don’t Expect Accurate Predictions From Fed,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-expect-accurate-predictions-from-fed-11604348029,"I understand why Lawrence B. Lindsey has a certain fondness for the Federal Reserve, but I question his desire to focus on any predictions made by economists at the Fed (“The Trump Boom Is Real,” op-ed, Oct. 26). He certainly knows the predictions of economists at the Fed (or anywhere else) on unemployment or GDP are rarely correct. This is another reminder that too much is expected from the Fed. It clearly has little control over employment, so it’s foolish to think predictions on unemployment by Fed economists carry any more or less weight than those of economists on Wall Street, corporate America or any decent university. 
Economics is part science and part art. The science portion seems more useful in measuring things that have already occurred. The art portion can be interesting, but only marginally helpful. I agree that President Trump’s policies have had some positive impacts on the economy. I’m curious though, what were Mr. Lindsey’s favorite economists predicting President Trump’s tariffs would do for our economy? Trade deficits went up, not down. President Trump was compelled to approve record amounts of aid to the agriculture sector. What does Mr. Lindsey think about the president’s fondness for significantly higher deficit spending (before the Covid-19 crisis)? The Fed probably has some predictions on what record postwar federal debt-to-GDP ratios might eventually do to our economy, but I won’t be taking them too seriously.

What is happening here now, we experienced 60 years ago in Cuba (“How Free Speech Dies,” Americas, Oct. 26). The intellectuals, with great passion, unknowingly helped Fidel Castro claw his way to power in the 1950s with “false democracy” ideals and speeches (supported by upper-class intellectuals, academics and media) while suffering under the Batista regime. Many of these people wound up either executed or languishing in appalling prisons for years. The most important lesson we can learn from Cuba’s experience is that Fidel Castro ran his communist revolution all the while promising democracy. We Cubans swallowed it hook, line and sinker, not realizing what would happen in the end. Practically all my Cuban-American friends of my age (upper 80s) agree about the similarity to today’s situation in America.

2020/11/03,What’s So Great About High Voter Turnout?,Upward Mobility,https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-so-great-about-high-voter-turnout-11604446984,"Nearly 100 million people voted before Election Day, which is just under three-quarters of the total vote in 2016. Partly, that’s due to pandemic fear of crowded polling places, but it also reflects a much broader concern about the current state of politics in America.
Some people vote out of civic duty, others when they are excited, and still others when they are anxious or even scared. But in a typical presidential year, more than 40% of all eligible voters don’t vote at all. Since 1980, the average turnout has been 56%, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. This year, predicts Michael McDonald, the University of Florida political scientist who administers the U.S. Elections Project, turnout may reach 65%, which is not only well above average for the past 40 years but a significant jump from the 59% who turned out in 2016. The last time 65% of eligible voters participated in a presidential election was in 1908. 
We had hints of what was to come in the 2018 midterms. Four year earlier, turnout was the lowest on record for any midterm election since World War II. In 2018, it was the highest in more than a century. Demographically, people with lower levels of education and income are less inclined to vote, as are recent immigrants. Democrats point to “voter suppression” as the reason, conveniently ignoring that black turnout has grown since the 1990s, even in states with strict voter ID laws, and that in 2012 it surpassed the rate of white voter turnout. An analysis of the 2018 elections by the Pew Research Center reported that “all major racial and ethnic groups saw historic jumps in voter turnout.”
The most likely culprit of lower voter turnout in the U.S. is widespread apathy. A 2008 Census Bureau survey of eligible but unregistered voters found that the largest percentage of respondents (46%) said they were “not interested in the election” or “not involved in politics.” Another 17.5% stated that they were “too busy” to vote, and 12.9% said that they didn’t care for the candidates or for the campaign issues being discussed. Just 6% cited registration problems.
Every so often there are calls for “universal” or mandatory voting laws to get more people engaged. But it’s the people who care about the outcome of an election who are most likely to participate. Do we really want their votes diluted by uninterested people who are voting only because it’s required by law? In a way, voter indifference can signal a healthy democracy. People who decide that voting isn’t worth their time are expressing contentment, a certain level of satisfaction with how much or how little politics and politicians intrude on their daily lives.

Voter turnout in 2008 was the highest since 1960 and no doubt reflected the historic nature of Barack Obama’s election. This year, the uptick in voting most likely reflects the electorate’s apprehension about the country’s future with Donald Trump at the helm, or at least that’s what Joe Biden and the Democrats hope. Mr. Biden spent the final days of his campaign appealing to the black voters who didn’t turn out for Hillary Clinton in Detroit and Philadelphia four years ago and thus may have cost her important swing states. They are the same voters I spoke with in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood a week after Mr. Trump was elected and most of the nation was still in shock.
The people I encountered weren’t Trump supporters, but neither were they especially surprised by his victory or panicky. If anything, they struck me as impassive. A minister told me that he supported the president-elect’s law-and-order message but that the federal government can only do so much about inner-city crime. A hair salon owner from West Africa told me that she thought Mr. Trump’s rants about walls and deportations were mostly bluster. An off-duty police officer said that Mrs. Clinton had spent too much time talking about foreign policy, which to him made her sound out of touch with what was happening here.
We’ll have to wait for the results to find out whether these attitudes hold four years later, but in important ways this relative indifference turned out to be warranted. Before the Covid outbreak, low-income minorities were experiencing record low levels of poverty and unemployment, and no one should be surprised if the president improves his performance among black and Hispanic voters on Tuesday.
In the end, that may not be enough to compensate for a 44% job-approval rating or a sharp decline in support among seniors and suburban women. But whether or not he wins a second term, Mr. Trump has succeeded demonstrably in undermining the left’s notion that Democratic governance is somehow a prerequisite for reducing social inequality in America.

2020/11/03,A Diagnosis for American Polarization,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-diagnosis-for-american-polarization-11604447133,"Why are evidence and reason largely absent from political discussion? Why are well-supported facts often no match for emotion? Much of it can be explained by a process called “splitting.” Though little known to the public, the term is used widely by mental-health professionals.
I first noticed splitting a few years ago, when I provided psychotherapy to a depressed college student. At first our sessions focused on her depression, but my patient, a white woman, took frequent detours into racial politics. She “loved” Malcolm X and railed against “white privilege.” Then she told me that she “identified” as black. 
She said she felt “black on the inside” because she “got it” and wasn’t ignorant or hateful. Everything she said about black people was positive, even idealizing. They were always blameless, strong victims. By contrast, everything she said about white people was aggressively critical and shaming. They were ignorant oppressors, fragile, selfish and guilty. One had no power; the other had all of it, and so forth. This led me to believe that she felt black because whiteness for her was intolerably negative, whereas blackness was appealing.
I was unsure how to respond. If I asked her if she felt anything positive about her white identity, the question could have provoked her. Besides, I couldn’t think of anything positive about white people that didn’t sound racist, even to my own ears. Nor could I think of a single shortcoming in another ethnic group that didn’t sound racist. Even exploring the topic in my own thoughts felt somehow wrong.
As her therapist, I wanted to help, but it wasn’t clear how to do so. Would it have been racist to ignore her comments or racist to explore them? Should she be free to see herself as black if she wanted? Or should she embrace her white identity? Or neither—should I encourage colorblindness?
The case was riddled with pitfalls. I think this is largely what people mean by “political correctness.” It isn’t that people are frustrated they can’t say racist things. It is that virtually any comment about race can be framed as racist. It is a maze without an escape, or at least it can feel that way. But eventually I found a framework for understanding my patient.
Splitting is a defense mechanism by which people unconsciously frame ideas, individuals or groups of people in all-or-nothing terms—for example, all good or all bad. The term was popularized in its current usage by the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein in the 1930s and ’40s. Its name describes how intolerable thoughts and feelings are split off from the subject’s awareness, leading to a partial view of the world. To see our opponents as pure evil, we have to split off the parts of them that are admirable. To see ourselves as purely righteous, we have to split off our shortcomings.
At the root of this process is distress over contradictions. It can be painful to think that the people we idealize are flawed and the people we loathe have virtues. By pushing these conflicts out of awareness, splitting reduces anxiety and makes the world appear more coherent—in the short term. It also severely distorts reality, making it hard to develop solutions to problems, which often grow worse as a result. Splitting can warp identity, morality, memories and desires. It makes conversation difficult, impairs relationships and can even lead to mental illness. 
Splitting was theorized by Klein to be an entirely unconscious process, so people don’t realize they’re doing it, or why. They’re unaware of the uncomfortable mix of emotions that arose, the anxiety that drove them to split, or their inability to tolerate nuance. 
How can we overcome splitting? In psychoanalysis, they say “interpret the defense before the content.” This means it is more effective to talk about splitting and how it works before shifting the dialogue to the pros and cons. Until we address the process of splitting itself, contrary evidence rarely penetrates.
After I found this framework for my patient, my views on identity politics changed dramatically. I saw splitting throughout our culture, and not only on race, but also on gender and other categories. Nonsplit comments can sound racist or sexist to many people. This affects most discussions of free speech, workplace discrimination and more.
Take a hypothetical sex disparity in mental health. If women were to have depression more often than men, sexism and male privilege would be normal explanations. But if men were to have a greater incidence of depression, the causes would likely include high female emotional intelligence, toxic masculinity and so forth. In other words, it doesn’t matter which group is over- or underrepresented. The causes are the same: male badness and female goodness. All nonsplit explanations end up sounding false and immoral—especially coming from a white man. 
People often rationalize their splitting. It can be argued that distorting the truth to frame entire groups as all good or all bad is “social justice.” Nonsplit observations can be dismissed as “social constructs” while split comments describe important “lived realities.” But none of these rhetorical moves change the fact that splitting distorts reality, is hurtful, and fosters division and hatred.
By the time I had developed this formulation, the patient had left treatment for unrelated reasons. It was heartbreaking. I think this approach could have helped her and others, too. Encouraging nonsplit dialogue could make the world a more enlightened place. It might even cure our disorder.

2020/11/03,How Rabin’s Assassination Gave New Life to Oslo,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-rabins-assassination-gave-new-life-to-oslo-11604447094,"Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated at a peace rally on Nov. 4, 1995. The day 25 years ago marks one of the lowest moments in Israeli—and even Jewish—history. This is not, as many believe, because Rabin’s assassination killed the Oslo peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. It didn’t. Hamas terrorism and Yasser Arafat’s lies did that. But that makes it no less essential to memorialize and even ritualize Rabin’s death. As the prime minister warned minutes before his murder: “Violence erodes the basis of Israeli democracy. It must be condemned and isolated.”
After two bullets felled Rabin, the Israeli democratic miracle that the Jewish people had built since 1948 seemed in danger. But at Rabin’s funeral the eulogies didn’t stress a unifying, nonpartisan worry about democracy, peace or national survival; instead, they emphasized one political camp’s fear that the Oslo process was threatened. President Bill Clinton defined Rabin as “a martyr for peace” rather than an avatar of democracy. Oslo—one diplomatic strategy that had already begun to fail—was in this way consecrated and romanticized. Rabin’s legacy became about perpetuating “his” peace process.
This spin overlooked Rabin’s growing skepticism about Palestinian intentions as Hamas bombs exploded and Arafat, president of the new Palestinian Authority, green-lighted terrorism. Rabin was particularly devastated by the Bus No. 5 suicide bombing in Tel Aviv on Oct. 19, 1994, in which 22 civilians were murdered, and the Beit Lid bus stop suicide bombings on Jan. 22, 1995, whose perpetrators murdered 20 young soldiers and one civilian. The Beit Lid attack also included an aborted plan to ambush Rabin. But Rabin’s doubts were buried with him.
We have opposed the Oslo Accords since Rabin signed them in 1993. Installing a dictator like Arafat in Ramallah was a strange way to make peace. Predictably, his regime oppressed Palestinians and threatened Israelis. The assassination abruptly shifted our energies from debating Oslo to mourning our leader.
The conventional wisdom is that Rabin’s assassin killed hope for peace. True, the evil act was intended to derail Oslo, but it backfired. Making Rabin a peace-process martyr artificially extended Oslo’s life. Suddenly, peace-process skeptics found themselves accused of pleasing the murderer. Sighing “If only Rabin were alive,” Oslo’s champions across the world could blame Israel for every clash, absolving Arafat and Palestinian terrorists of responsibility.
For 25 years the perpetual peace-processors have demanded more Israeli concessions, believing that one more withdrawal or gesture will appease Palestinian maximalists. There is a magical faith that if only a brave leader like Rabin emerged, he could bring peace whatever the circumstances—whether Israel’s partner recognizes its right to exist or not.
As Jews, the world experts at turning tragedies into nation-building opportunities, we should have used Rabin’s monstrous murder to restore unity and strengthen democracy. Unfortunately, partisan furies overpowered metaphysical hopes.
Likud’s unexpected victory over Rabin’s successor, Shimon Peres, in 1996 further fouled the atmosphere. Peres’s disappointed supporters blamed the victor, Benjamin Netanyahu, for the rhetoric that killed Rabin. “First you murdered, then you stole” the election, some Peres supporters cried. Only a few made this awful accusation publicly, but many believed it privately. Nearly everyone on Israel’s left blamed anyone on Israel’s right for Rabin’s death—and for anything else that misfired with the Palestinians. Every Oslo critic became a Brutus.
These ridiculous accusations helped right-wing ideologues dodge the hard questions and necessary soul-searching about their behavior during the anti-Oslo campaign: Did we cross the line with posters of Rabin in an Arafat-style kaffiyeh or an SS uniform? Did we dehumanize our opponents? Did we fuel the lynch-mob atmosphere?
If memorializing Rabin remains so intertwined with idealizing Oslo, the magnitude of the assassin’s crime risks being minimized when peace finally breaks out or a different approach works. Today the Abraham Accords offer a new and improved model of peacemaking. Rather than trusting demagogues like Arafat, who need Israel as the Palestinians’ enemy for their own survival, the latest agreements are with willing partners in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. By normalizing relations, the plan is to build trust from the bottom up through cultural, economic and diplomatic exchange.
It is time to stop politicizing Rabin’s assassination, a tragedy of biblical proportions. Let’s master the moral lesson about debating with raised voices and firm principles without turning violent or writing off one another. Building on tradition, this awful anniversary should become a new Jewish fast day. It would make a moral statement: We affirm the importance not of mere tolerance, but of true acceptance of our fellow citizens and their right to disagree with us.

2020/11/03,Why Your Vote Matters,Future View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-your-vote-matters-11604447028,"Editor’s note: In this Future View, students discuss why voting and democracy matter. Next week we’ll ask, “What can each party learn from the election result?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Nov. 10. The best responses will be published that night.
The Rational-Voter Paradox
Economists have long theorized that the potential cost of voting, for a rational, self-interested citizen, will generally exceed any potential benefit he will receive from voting. One vote won’t likely swing an election, but it takes time, effort and attention to follow the news, learn about the candidates, form an opinion, show up to the polls, and wait in line to vote. As an economics student, I’m tempted to say it isn’t worth it. But the rational-voter paradox misses something important: the intrinsic dignity and honor that each vote carries.

The freedom of the average citizen to join in choosing who will lead his nation isn’t commonplace in the annals of history. The election process that we enjoy in America also comes at a cost. It includes the blood of patriots who faced the British in the Revolutionary War, the toil of suffragettes who fought for a chance to have a say, and the protests of African-Americans who struggled to have their voices heard. Even now, our right to self-government is protected by the free will of men and women who put their own safety at risk to serve in our military and defend our country.
Will your vote substantively influence the election? The rational-voter paradox would tell us that it doesn’t. But does your vote serve as a testament to the price that has been paid for our liberty? Does it remind us that we are citizens with full rights who deserve to be treated as such by the leaders we elect? Our knowledge of the past tells us that it does.
—Aaron Schnoor, Campbell University, wealth management and economics

Say No to Conformity
My vote matters because it is mine. There are people who believe that I must vote a certain way because of my skin color or social position, but they’re wrong. My vote allows me to defy the social order—to reject what I’m supposed to think. I don’t have to conform, and I will let no one else speak for me. The greatness of democracy is that each vote is counted, even the ones that run counter to the prevailing view imposed from on high, or the groupthink that can permeate the culture.
—Ramon Montalvo IV, University of Texas at Austin, finance
Our Duty
Only by voting do we have a chance to shape the policies that will decide the future of this country. If regular people don’t inform ourselves and participate, the most ideological and divisive elements of society will have a voice too large to calm. Too many people have fought and even died for my right to vote for me to ignore my responsibility. America’s future is at stake.
—Susan Hubbard, Santa Barbara City College, political science
Democracy Is Only Half the Story
Voting is a necessary safeguard against a tyrannical government. In these times, however, excessive partiality toward the concept of democracy comes at the expense of the other pillars that underpin the U.S. constitutional structure. This leads to misconceptions about how our government works.
In many ways the American system of government has been durable because of its antidemocratic elements. We forget, for instance, that the Constitution was drafted behind closed doors. That process imposed countermajoritarian restraints on democracy. From the constitutional amendment process to the presidential veto, sweeping changes are by design difficult to effectuate. This structure protects minority rights and requires deliberation and persuasion to get things done. Focusing on democracy alone jettisons that framework; a simple majority of the vote doesn’t and shouldn’t rule all areas of life.
Democracy is a necessary check on minority rule. The genius of the Constitution, however, is to channel democratic passions through a process of refinement that should produce better outcomes than direct majority rule. Unfortunately, the allure of democracy has caused an increasing number of Americans to forget countermajoritarianism and even pluralism—the right of Texas to go a different way than California even if Democrats win a national election. These days there’s too much focus on democracy and too little on rudimentary civics. 
—Ethan Lamb, Georgetown University, law (J.D.)
Your Own Advocate
Every vote matters because every voice matters. The U.S. is supposed to be a land of opportunity, but how can it be if the people don’t get a say in how resources are distributed or the big decisions are made? For generations, people have fought for the right to vote because they understood that no one can know what you need better than yourself, and no one will speak up for you like you can. By granting each of us the right to vote, democracy recognizes our dignity as human beings. It reaffirms that we are all equal and should have the same say in how our lives are run.
—Jada Badillo, Smith College, government
“ For generations, people have fought for the right to vote because they understood that no one can know what you need better than yourself, and no one will speak up for you like you can. ”
Our Democratic Sacrament
Does my vote matter? Yes and no. A presidential election is a high holy day for many in our country, like Passover, Ramadan or Easter. Voting can be seen as a democratic sacrament, connecting one to all. Yet on Jan. 20 the victor will take the oath of office with his hand on a gilded book that generally has damning things to say about human rulers. 
In the first pages of the Bible, Adam and Eve are introduced as a royal couple that fails in its responsibilities and is ousted from the Garden. The saga of Israel throughout the Hebrew Bible recapitulates this Edenic disappointment; a string of failed kings leads the people into exile. The New Testament contrasts the Kingdom of God and kingdoms of the world—oppressive Caesars and corrupt leadership in Israel. 
The American political liturgy climaxes, then, with a cautionary symbol—swearing on a Good Book that warns against placing ultimate hope in self-proclaimed good men. Unless the humble nature of the inaugural ceremony is seen afresh, all my vote will do is contribute to another cycle of political polarization, one way or the other. “Put not your trust in princes,” the Psalmist says, “in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation.”
—Ryan Gregg, Harvard University, religion (Ph.D.)
Free Expression
My vote matters today more than ever. Voting increasingly seems to be the last means to freely express one’s views. Big Tech may censor what you post on their platforms, but neither Jack Dorsey nor Mark Zuckerberg can touch your vote. The social-media mob may “cancel” you or hound you out of a job, but it can’t follow you into the ballot booth.
—John Arthur Whitaker, University of Arkansas, law (J.D.)
Most Votes Don’t Matter
The only vote that matters is the one that decides who wins. The rest are mere opinion polling. And the probability of my vote being that deciding vote is vanishingly small. That’s why Americans generally cast their votes as if they don’t matter—not taking the time to learn about the rival candidates’ policies—or don’t vote at all.
Besides, the option I want to choose isn’t on the ballot. I would vote to leave a number of posts vacant before permitting any of the current candidates to exercise their evident lack of judgment. If a majority wants, why not let it throw the bums out and not let any new ones in?
—Timothy Olmsted, Purdue University, economics (M.S.)
“ By voting, we remind the world that democracy continues to work. These days, we could all use such a reminder. ”
A Light Unto the Nations
Numerically speaking, democracy is in decline. In 2019 the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index recorded its worst average global score since its inaugural report in 2006. Now, in 2020 the merits of a free society have been thrown into doubt as the most celebrated aspects of liberal democracy became fatal impediments to fighting Covid-19. Yet compared with the alternatives, no other system has afforded humanity a greater level of freedom and prosperity.
When the Soviet Union collapsed, communism was dealt a fatal blow around the world. If America were to enter a terminal decline, could not democracy suffer the same fate? As the world’s oldest extant democracy, the U.S. is the standard-bearer for that system of government.
When America votes, it shows the world that democracy still works. Despite a dangerous pandemic and increasingly bitter political polarization, Americans will make their biennial sojourn to the ballot box to cast their votes—a ritual uninterrupted for more than two centuries. By voting, we remind the world that democracy continues to work. These days, we could all use such a reminder.
—Zachary Boyd, New York Institute of Technology, computer science

2020/11/03,100 Years of Media Lying,Business World,https://www.wsj.com/articles/100-years-of-media-lying-11604446869,"The media contretemps of the day, the departure of irascible left-wing journalist Glenn Greenwald from the news site he co-founded, TheIntercept.com, is only partly a result of his insistence on taking seriously new evidence that Joe Biden became mixed up in his son’s influence-peddling business, which his editors apparently thought overwrought.
A back story is the lingering miasma over the press’s handling of the Steele dossier and its promotion of the Russia collusion story. Mr. Greenwald and a handful of colleagues on the left inconveniently have not been satisfied with the press’s non-accountability in the matter. He published a piece under the headline “ Robert Mueller Obliterated Trump-Russia Conspiracy Theories.” He published another on the “The 10 Worst, Most Embarrassing U.S. Media Failures on the Trump-Russia Story.” He and a few others, such as Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone, spent recent years demonstrating the unweird proposition that a journalist can be both anti-Trump and anti-lies-about-Trump. 
If his name rings a bell, Mr. Greenwald was an ally of Edward Snowden and continues to defend the betrayer and leaker of American intelligence secrets. Whatever the merits of the position, it left him skeptical of former intelligence chiefs John Brennan and James Clapper in their latest brazenness, demanding that newly revealed information about the Bidens be treated as Russian disinformation despite a lack of evidence of Russian involvement and despite the Bidens themselves not denying the authenticity of the newly disclosed information.
Alas, there’s no sign of this being slapped down as it should. We are in danger of becoming like Russia, where intelligence officials try to control our domestic politics with lies and intimidation. What was the “objectivity” that journalists once prized and now treat as an encumbrance except an all-purpose wall against such pressures and temptations to publish fantasy in place of reality? Unfortunately, a natural suspicion is that the institutional press rallied around the Bidens partly in an unspoken hope that Tuesday’s election would let it slink away from any reckoning over the collusion hoax.
The year 2020 will be memorable for a few reasons but it wouldn’t hurt to mark the 100th anniversary of journalist and critic Walter Lippmann’s “Liberty and the News.” In reissuing the book in 2007, Princeton University Press called it the “classic account of how the press threatens democracy whenever it has an agenda other than the free flow of ideas.”
Lippmann, at 31, was not yet the Pulitzer-sanctified friend and nagger of the powerful he would become, with a syndicated column that ran from 1931 to 1967. His youthful critique rings bells today. He complained of a press addicted to “standardized constellations of ideas,” who “come to believe [their] habitual emphasis is the only possible one,” and who self-interestedly exaggerate and overplay the importance of whatever is being reported (in our age to the point of hysteria). 
He had faith in the reader not to be siloed or bubbled as we like to say now. The public’s “desire to know, the dislike of being deceived and made game of” was a foundation of our every democratic hope. And a reporter’s highest function was to provide relevant and reliable facts. “In his professional activity it is no business of [the reporter’s] to care whose ox is gored.”

What stands out for me, though, is his repeated invocation of phrases such as the “uses of evidence,” “standards of evidence,” “a sense of evidence.” A century later ours is still a profession that doesn’t treat evidence seriously, that a hundred times a day blithely asserts propositions that the reported facts don’t support. A culture of actual stupidity reigns in many newsrooms where careful reasoning is jauntily eschewed in favor of treating facts as unrelated adornments on predetermined story lines.
Of course nothing is new under the sun. The parable of the emperor’s new clothes is believed to date, in some form, to the 14th century. The term groupthink was popularized in the 1970s. Lippmann spoke of “stereotypes”; today we talk about “narratives.” Lately behavioral economics has contributed the terms “availability bias” and “preference falsification” for our incentive to believe what others believe, or pretend to, as well as our disincentive to invest in learning about a topic if all we want is to exhibit the approved opinion.
These will always be hurdles to an honest and competent press as long as we have a press. A mainstream media in cahoots with dishonest and manipulative intelligence sources, on the other hand, is a special problem that falls to our generation to put right. I don’t underrate the commercial motives at play. People flock to websites that tell them what they want to hear; they also seek out information that is objective and reliable. Both may be good businesses but we in journalism, especially the cable channels, need to decide which business we’re in.

2020/11/03,"Philly, Catholics and Foster Kids",Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/philly-catholics-and-foster-kids-11604445735,"Religious liberty is America’s first freedom, enshrined in the opening 16 words of the Bill of Rights. But the rise of progressive secularism is putting increased tension on American pluralism. Case in point is Fulton v. Philadelphia, an appeal from a Catholic foster agency that the Supreme Court will take up Wednesday.
To the left, the case is simple: Catholic Social Services (CSS) won’t certify gay couples for foster placements. Philadelphia says this violates the city’s nondiscrimination rules, meaning that CSS can no longer be contracted as a foster agency unless it changes its policy. CSS sued. To hear progressives, what it’s asking for is a religious license to discriminate against Philly’s LGBT citizens.
The details are more complicated. Religious work in this sphere goes back centuries, and CSS says the first Catholic orphanage in Philadelphia dates to 1798. Today about two dozen agencies facilitate foster care. For decades, that included CSS. It serves all children, regardless of sexuality. If a gay couple were to ask for a home study, CSS would refer them elsewhere. “But the record shows,” it says, “that no same-sex couple had ever approached CSS in this way.”
The genesis of the case was a Philadelphia Inquirer article in 2018 that highlighted the CSS policy. Soon thereafter, CSS says a city official pushed it to change its approach, saying that it’s “not 100 years ago” and urging it to follow “the teachings of Pope Francis. ” The official, according to the city, is also Catholic and was merely trying to find common ground.
When CSS refused to budge, the city froze its foster referrals and its contract was allowed to expire. An appeals court sided with the city, saying that CSS is owed no exemption, since the nondiscrimination policy is “a neutral, generally applicable law.” The precedent here is the 1990 ruling in Employment Division v. Smith, in which a Native American was denied state benefits after using peyote in a ritual.
CSS argues that the appeals court was wrong, that its beliefs were treated with hostility. It adds that foster care isn’t a “public accommodation” like a restaurant. Agencies weigh prospective parents based on subjective judgments about their family lives. The city may consider race when placing specific children.
Maybe that’s enough to win, but CSS also asks the Court to throw out Smith as “unsupported by the text, history, and tradition of the Free Exercise Clause.” An amicus brief by a Jewish group adds that minority faiths have the most at stake: Imagine a hypothetical law that “required practices incompatible with kosher animal slaughter.” The brief cites the case of a family denied damages after a child was given an autopsy “against the commands of their Hmong faith.”
Philadelphia counters that CSS does not have a constitutional right to work “on the City’s behalf, with City funds, pursuant to a City contract, in a manner that the City has determined would be harmful to its residents.” An obvious solution is for Philadelphia to give CSS an exemption, while explaining to the public that foster care exists to help children and that gay couples are welcomed by other agencies.
But the progressive winners of the culture war seem unwilling to give quarter to the losers. In 2008 Barack Obama said he believed “that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.” A decade later, CSS was told that its policy, based on the same view, disqualified it from longstanding good work with Philadelphia’s children. Meantime, Joe Biden wants to renew the effort to foist contraceptives onto the health plans offered by the Little Sisters of the Poor.
In a big, diverse country of 330 million people, questions of religion are best approached with an inclination toward pluralism and an attitude of live and let live. But if that’s too much to hope as militant secularism advances, then at least the faithful have the First Amendment.

2020/11/03,Edward Snowden’s New Loyalty,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/edward-snowdens-new-loyalty-11604445616,"Although National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden has settled in Russia, he has insisted that his “ultimate goal” is to return to the U.S. But the fugitive now has begun the process of formally pledging loyalty to the Russian state.
“In this era of pandemics and closed borders, we’re applying for dual US-Russian citizenship,” he tweeted Sunday. Mr. Snowden and his wife are Americans, so the real news is that he is pursuing a Russian passport. Moscow already has granted permanent residency to the former NSA contractor.
Vladimir Putin’s government gave Mr. Snowden asylum in 2013, after he fled the U.S. to avoid criminal charges for leaking a massive collection of classified documents. He leads a comfortable life in Russia, earning at least $5 million from a book deal and speaking fees. Mr. Snowden occasionally criticizes the Russian government but appeared alongside Mr. Putin in 2014 to ask about Russian surveillance. His softball question set up a propaganda coup for Moscow.
The disclosure of post-9/11 intelligence gathering received most of the attention when Mr. Snowden handed over stolen data to ideologically sympathetic reporters. But the Snowden disclosures went far beyond that. They revealed, for instance, information about American surveillance of Chinese telecom firm Huawei, which the U.S. considers a national-security threat. U.S. allies like Japan and Australia also were exposed. This helped authoritarian states while damaging free societies.
A bipartisan 2016 House Intelligence Committee report accused Mr. Snowden of having been in contact with Russian intelligence. He denies it. Yet it’s reasonable to wonder why a former KGB officer like Mr. Putin would let Mr. Snowden settle in Russia unmolested if he hadn’t provided valuable intelligence.
In August President Trump said he was “going to take a very good look” at pardoning Mr. Snowden. He seems to equate Mr. Snowden’s fate with the opposition by some in the intelligence community to his Presidency. But this would be a terrible misjudgment. Mr. Snowden betrayed his country. Giving him a pardon would validate his betrayal and tell other would-be leakers and spies that they too can obtain absolution if they turn themselves into martyrs against the “deep state.” 
The left wing of the Democratic Party would also pressure Joe Biden for a Snowden pardon, as they did Barack Obama. Mr. Snowden’s pledge of allegiance to Russia reveals his true sympathies, and he deserves his fate in exile unless he returns to the U.S. and confronts the charges against him in a trial.

2020/11/03,"Britain Locks Down, Again",Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/britain-locks-down-again-11604445556,"Less than a year ago Boris Johnson won a historic victory, and an 80-seat parliamentary majority, in the U.K.’s last general election. You might have forgotten, because now Mr. Johnson is lurching from one political misstep to another. The new Covid-19 lockdown he announced over the weekend may be the worst.
Everything about this second lockdown is going wrong for Mr. Johnson so far. His announcement was botched—pre-empted by leaks to the media from within his own government, which forced him to unveil the measures days earlier than planned. He looks muddled and indecisive because he is imposing a month-long lockdown when only weeks ago he argued a two-week lockdown would be a “disaster.”
The new policy is motivated by concern over swamping the socialized National Health Service if coronavirus cases keep rising. The NHS is swamped every year by seasonal flu, although the models may be wrong to assume the same would happen this year. Social distancing and handwashing appear to have suppressed normal flu in the southern hemisphere this summer.
The nebulous science and bad economics of the new lockdown are prompting a rebellion among Tories, about a dozen of whom may vote against their Prime Minister Wednesday when the lockdown comes before Parliament. Several dozen more are unhappy with the restriction but may toe the line for now. They’re worried about whether there is an exit plan after senior government minister Michael Gove on Sunday hinted the lockdown could be extended through Christmas.
Mr. Johnson has been forced to promise he won’t do this, and he has agreed to submit any extension beyond Dec. 2 to Parliament. He can’t assume he’d win that vote if the public can’t celebrate Christmas.
Part of Mr. Johnson’s political trouble arises because the opposition Labour Party claims the new lockdown wouldn’t have been necessary if only Mr. Johnson had acted sooner. That’s easy for Labour to say since they’re not accountable for the economic wreckage. But the message might resonate with frustrated voters now imagining another month stuck in their homes and, for many, off work.
A new political challenge is arising from Nigel Farage, who’s converting his old Brexit Party into a new anti-lockdown party called Reform UK. Mr. Farage’s critics often brand him an opportunist, but his base has always been England’s northern working class and he knows his supporters.
Those voters handed Mr. Johnson the election victory in December on the strength of the Prime Minister’s Brexit convictions, but they stand to lose the most economically the longer lockdowns grind on. Mr. Johnson should worry if Mr. Farage spies a new political opportunity among these crucial voters.
Polls still show around 70% of Britons say they support lockdown measures, but public behavior such as haphazard social distancing and fudging of current restrictions on socializing suggest lockdown fatigue is mounting. Someone will have to find a workable balance among Covid precautions, the economy, human nature and mental health. Mr. Johnson’s latest lockdown isn’t it.

2020/11/03,"An American, Born in Jerusalem",Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-american-born-in-jerusalem-11604445511,"It took more than a decade, but Menachem Zivotofsky can finally list the country of his birth on his U.S. passport. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that news last week, and on Friday U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman presented the first passport so marked to Mr. Zivotofsky, the American who as an infant began the legal saga that brought us to this day.
Mr. Zivotofsky was born in 2002 to U.S. citizens living in Jerusalem. That year Congress passed a measure directing the State Department to give U.S. citizens like him the option of listing their birthplace as Israel on their passports. President George W. Bush signed the bill but in a signing statement argued that the law impinged on a President’s constitutional authority over foreign policy. 
So when Mr. Zivotofsky’s parents asked for Israel to be stamped in their son’s U.S. passport in accord with the new law, the State Department refused. What followed was more than a decade of litigation, which ended in 2015 with the Supreme Court siding with the President over Congress. But President Trump has now acted to carry out what Congress had directed, so that debate is moot.
The passport issue is the latest step involving Israel that other U.S. Presidents of both parties have been reluctant to take because they thought them too diplomatically sensitive. These include the Trump Administration’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017, moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem in 2018, recognizing Israeli control over the Golan Heights in 2019, and last week’s decision to lift a ban on U.S. funding for Israeli scientific research projects in the West Bank and Golan. 
The usual foreign-policy suspects predicted catastrophe. Instead these examples of steadfast U.S. support for Israel contributed to the new landmark diplomatic relationships between Israel and its Arab neighbors from Sudan and the Emirates to Bahrain.
For all Mr. Trump’s norm busting, here he is upholding one. When the Zivotofsky case was before the Supreme Court, the argument was about how far a President’s authority extends when he acts alone. But when he acts as he’s doing here—“pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress”—the Court confirms a President’s authority is at its maximum.

2020/11/03,Pelosi and the Judiciary,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/pelosi-and-the-judiciary-11604444485,"This column understands that for some members of the media, presenting President Donald Trump as a threat to the republic never gets old. But pundits who’ve spent years accusing Mr. Trump of trashing vaguely defined constitutional norms might want to pay some attention to the running commentary from one of America’s other senior political leaders.
The Hill’s Joe Concha notes today:
Of course there is nothing illegitimate at all about the justice, who was constitutionally appointed by the president and confirmed by a vote of the Senate. And Justice Barrett is not the only jurist Mrs. Pelosi seeks to delegitimize. On Friday Jennifer Bendery wrote in the Huff Post:
Is there any politician in America making a more consistent, forceful and dishonest effort to undermine the independence of the federal judiciary? On October 26 the speaker went on MSNBC and falsely claimed that the lawful confirmation of Justice Barrett was “the undoing of the system of checks and balances.”
The speaker has a habit of attacking the Supreme Court whenever justices don’t render the political outcome she demands, such as a decision last month on the conduct of the census.
In 2018 a Journal editorial described an eminently reasonable Supreme Court decision upholding Ohio’s policy to keep its voter data current:
This was apparently beyond the pale for the speaker, who issued a press release claiming the nation’s highest court was “attacking voting rights.” According to the Pelosi statement: 
Some readers may have noticed that in 2020 Mrs. Pelosi has been working to facilitate voting by mail as an essential part of our democratic process. But apparently in 2018 using the mail to confirm eligibility to vote was “mass disenfranchisement.”
Also in 2020—September, to be exact—the speaker went on ABC and dropped another casual condemnation of the work of the independent judiciary. “The Congress has the ability to overturn the injustices that spring from the Supreme Court,” said Mrs. Pelosi to anchorman George Stephanopoulos.
Like a number of other Democrats, the speaker has lately been discussing adding justices to the Supreme Court and perhaps also expanding the number of district courts in the federal system. If the norms are destroyed, the rights may follow.

2020/11/03,Masks Are No Panacea but Make Good Sense,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/masks-are-no-panacea-but-make-good-sense-11604432909,"Regarding Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo’s “Masks Are a Distraction From the Pandemic Reality” (op-ed, Oct. 29): In February when epidemeologist Chen Chien-Jen, was Taiwan’s vice president, he instituted the strictest mask mandate of any country with a weekly allocation of high-quality masks to everyone. Despite direct flights from Wuhan, Taiwan has had only seven Covid deaths in seven months. 
Dr. Ladapo cites an old study from June. The University of Kansas recently released a study on the effectiveness of mask wearing which says Kansas counties with a mask mandate have an infection rate 50% lower compared with those without. Taiwan and Kansas conducted large-population studies that leave little doubt that masks work. We need to make high-quality, three- or four-layer surgical or N95 masks available to everyone, together with a strong national mask mandate as Taiwan has. 
If we follow Taiwan’s lead, we could lower the coronavirus’s reproduction rate to under one, thereby controlling it.

Masks are low-tech and, though there is some scientific debate, provide either a small or a large benefit in preventing the spread of the virus. I believe we can walk and chew gum (i.e., implement other safeguards) at the same time.
Prof. Joel E. Fishman, M.D., Ph.D.
University of Miami School of Medicine

Dr. Ladapo fails to distinguish between the effectiveness of government mandates to wear masks and the effectiveness of actually wearing masks. Mask mandates in the U.S. haven't been as effective as they could be because many people aren’t complying. It is indisputable that U.S.-manufactured N95 masks stop 95% of viral particles from entering the wearer’s nasal passages and thereby greatly reduce the chance of infection. This is why our health-care workers wear them. Studies have shown that the cloth masks worn by the public can offer protection to the wearer in the 30% to 50% range, depending on the fit and fabric used. And if two people are in close proximity and talking to one another, and both individuals are wearing cloth masks, the protection is even greater. Wearing masks curbs the spread of the Covid virus, and the more people who wear masks, the greater the reduction in infections.
Robert Sommers, Ph.D.
Jacksonville, Fla.
What is it about masks that encourages facile rationalization against common sense? Which do you believe, obscure statistical studies or your own eyes? And if required to spend 45 minutes in a Walmart store, which would you rather have: no one wearing masks or everyone? 
Mark Wetmore
Vermillion, S.D.
Dr. Lodapo fails to address an important lack in current debates about controlling and combating the virus. Citizens and politicians alike have grasped tightly onto the idea of masks as a helpful measure for a reason: It is something concrete, physical and positive we all can do.

2020/11/03,Brazil’s Government Is Protecting Its Forests,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-government-is-protecting-its-forests-11604432824,"President Jair Bolsonaro has declared on multiple occasions that the Brazilian government maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward environmental crime (“Illegal Loggers Undercut Brazil Forest Efforts,” World News, Oct. 29). Those words have been translated into actions. A special legislation—the Guarantee of Law and Order decree—was adopted to allow the use of the armed forces in the protection of the Amazon rainforest. Thousands of troops have been deployed to that end. In the case of Rondônia, the object of particular attention in the story, Brazil’s federal police launched an operation last July against illegal logging in that state. Other similar operations have been implemented, achieving concrete results. In October, the federal police also dismantled a criminal group involved in illegal timber trade acting in conservation units and indigenous lands in the states of Goiás and Pará.
The Brazilian administration formed a National Council for the Legal Amazon, headed by Vice President Hamilton Mourão, to fight environmental crimes in the Amazon rainforest and foster sustainable development. A task force, with a total cost on the order of $70 million, started its work in May under the auspices of the council. It has seized more than six million cubic feet of illegal wood, and more than $260 million in environmental fines have been paid since then.

2020/11/03,Exaggeration Keeps Democratic Pols United,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/exaggeration-keeps-democratic-pols-united-11604432625,"Regarding Lance Morrow’s “The Amazing, Horrifying Age of Exaggeration” (op-ed, Oct. 28): Talk about exaggeration! Didn’t Mr. Morrow watch the hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation? According to the Democratic opposition (without even asking her a question), she was going to eliminate health care for millions of Americans. And then after her confirmation, Sen. Chuck Schumer said that this was “one of the darkest days” in the history of the Senate.
One reason for this hyperbole is that members of the opposition can never accept gracefully that they lost on any issue. It is interesting that there have been Republican congressmen and senators who seem to think for themselves based on moral principles such as Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and the late John McCain. However, the Democratic opposition has been consistently a unified bloc. Does that mean that Democrats can’t think for themselves? What is the influence that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have that can keep their members from even considering or voting for something that their leadership doesn’t want? Is it all a matter of money and power? Is that why we elected our representatives?

Henderson and Ryan Sullivan’s “End the School Shutdown” (op-ed, Oct. 21), reader Douglas Peterson wrote that he believes teachers are overly exposed to Covid when they are at school (Letters, Oct. 28). On the contrary, research has shown that children are at very low risk of getting sick from the virus and, importantly, that teachers and day-care workers are no more likely to become infected than most other professions.
For those teachers who continue to avoid schools, logic dictates that they also avoid stores and restaurants given the risk of those locations likely exceeds that of a school. I wonder if any of these concerned teachers have set foot in a grocery store or have gone out to dinner since March. I’m just asking for a friend.

2020/11/04,Tuesday’s Big Loser: Identity Politics,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/tuesdays-big-loser-identity-politics-11604535714,"It wasn’t clear by Wednesday afternoon who had won the White House, but one bad idea was soundly defeated on Tuesday: identity politics. The concept that the country should be divided into aggrieved categories based on race, national origin or sex—now a core tenet of the Democratic Party—lost from coast to coast.
It lost in Miami-Dade County, Fla., where Cuban-Americans delivered votes for President Trump. We don’t know the final margin, but some polls going into the election had the president leading among Cuban-American voters by a margin as wide as 38 points. Identity politics also lost in Osceola County, near Orlando, where Mr. Trump appears to have done better than expected among Puerto Rican voters.
Identity politics lost in South Texas: Zapata County, 95% Mexican-American, went for Hillary Clinton by 33 points in 2016—but Mr. Trump won with 52.5% this time. Throughout the Rio Grande Valley, President Trump did better in 2020 than in 2016: In Starr County he lost by only five points (47% to Mr. Biden’s 52%), compared with a 60-point spread in Mrs. Clinton’s favor four years ago. In Jim Hogg County Mr. Trump lost by 18 points, down from more than 50 in 2016. In Webb County Mr. Trump won 36.6% of the vote, up from 22.8% in 2016.
Identity politics even took it on the chin in California, where voters defeated an attempt to revoke Proposition 209, the 1996 ballot measure that bans the use of race, national origin or sex by state universities and other agencies. The left has spent almost a quarter-century trying to reverse that decision, but its latest attempt lost handily.
Chinese-American parents in the Golden State led the opposition to this attempt to reintroduce racial preferences, sometimes fighting Asian-American affinity organizations such as Chinese for Affirmative Action and Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which seem to put the interests of leftist white donors ahead of those of immigrant parents.
In other words, the progressive cobbling of pan-ethnicities that dates to the 1970s—a way to instill members of minority groups with grievances and push them to overthrow the American constitutional system—took a hit this Election Day.
 Nikole Hannah-Jones, the pugnacious creator of the New York Times’s “1619 Project,” tweeted on Tuesday: “One day after this election is over I am going to write a piece about how Latino is a contrived ethnic category that artificially lumps white Cubans with Black Puerto Ricans and indigenous Guatemalans and helps explains [sic] why Latinos support Trump at the second highest rate.”
Not every day do I agree with Ms. Hannah-Jones. But I’ve written two books, multiple research papers, essays and op-eds on this matter, and she is correct: These are contrived categories, fabricated terms “with no basis in ethnicity, culture, or race,” as I put it in a 2019 essay.
Ms. Hannah-Jones subsequently tweeted that the Latino category and others were “created by white people.” They were, though not the way she imagines. These categories were the brainchild of leftist activists—in the “Hispanic” case, Chicano movement activists—who were often richly funded by the likes of the Ford Foundation and other backers, and who then put incredible pressure on reluctant bureaucrats to make these groups official in the census and all other government surveys.
The activists weren’t after accurate counts, then or now, no matter what they say. They wanted to create minorities. As the Berkeley professor Cristina Mora aptly puts in her 2014 book, “Making Hispanics”: “It is one thing to classify a population and another to count it. For Mexican American and Puerto Rican activists in the late 1960s, these issues were inherently related.”
This is why La Raza executive director Raul Yzaguirre urged the Census Bureau in 1974 to drop the national-origin questions it had been asking for more than a century and instead create groups. “There is a difference between a minority group and a national origin group—a difference recognized in terms of national economic and social policies,” he wrote.
The instilling of grievances into the members of the minority groups is carried out by organizations like Asian Americans Advancing Justice, for “Asian-Americans,” or by groups like Voto Latino, for “Hispanics.” Listen to what Voto Latino María Teresa Kumar said during an August Zoom call that also included Ms. Hannah-Jones and Black Lives Matter founder Alicia Garza :
“The challenge with the work that I do at Voto Latino is that I can’t get people agitated because often times they don’t know the great harm that has happened under the structures that we have been raised by,” she said. “But once they start understanding it and recognizing it, they act and react, and fight and run for office.” 
In other words, Ms. Kumar sees her job as indoctrination, telling immigrants and their children that the country they have come to is an awful place, which owes them compensatory justice. That such absurd propositions were defeated throughout the country by voters who saw themselves as Americans, not victims, is something to be celebrated, no matter who wins the White House.

2020/11/04,Biden Had No Election Coattails,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-had-no-election-coattails-11604535684,"In this wild year of challenge and disruption, nobody should have expected a simple and easy finish to the presidential contest. Despite press declarations that President Trump (who led in none of the 80 national polls conducted since Labor Day) didn’t have a chance, he barnstormed the country, displaying the energy of a man half his age. Clearly enjoying himself, the president left it all out on the field. As this article went to press, Mr. Trump had fought his way into contention.
The president scored surprising victories in places where many had written him off, like Florida, Iowa and Ohio. Now that Michigan has been called for Joe Biden, up 1.2 points with 3% to go, the race comes down to six states. With Mr. Biden leading by 0.6 percentage point, or less than 21,000 votes, Wisconsin is going to a recount. Recounts rarely see even close to one-point swings, though we’ve never seen an election like this. With Mr. Trump up by 1.4 points, or more than 68,000 votes, Georgia is working the 6% of the vote still outstanding (mostly in Atlanta).
The president also leads Mr. Biden in North Carolina by 1.4 points, or more than 76,000 votes, with 5% of the vote yet to be counted. Mr. Biden is ahead in Nevada by 0.6 and Arizona by 3.4 points, both with 14% of the vote still out. 
Mr. Trump is ahead in Pennsylvania, with 51.4% of the vote to Mr. Biden’s 47.3%. The president’s 256,000-vote margin in the Keystone State may sound substantial, and Mr. Trump has already declared victory. But 14% of the vote—several hundred thousand mail-in ballots—remains to be counted, and mail-ins have tended to boost the Democrats.
Though the campaign is over, there’s still work to be done. The counting of the remaining mail-in ballots is under the control of local election boards. Each state has its own structure and process, but both parties will be involved in conducting and witnessing the counts. When there are attempts to rig the outcome, every candidate and both parties have speedy access to the courts. This is as it should be, since there is nothing more important to our democracy than free, fair and accurate elections.
There are suspicious partisans across the spectrum who believe widespread election fraud is possible. Some hanky-panky always goes on, and there are already reports of poll watchers in Philadelphia not being allowed to do their jobs. But stealing hundreds of thousands of votes would require a conspiracy on the scale of a James Bond movie. That isn’t going to happen.
The race for the White House wasn’t Election Day’s only story. In the battle for the U.S. Senate, Republicans appear to have pulled off what a few weeks ago looked nearly impossible. They likely keep their majority, surviving a giant flood of Democratic money. No Republican in a competitive race had anything close to the tens of millions of dollars that individual Democratic opponents hauled in. But elections are about more than money.
Right now Democrats look to have 48 Senate seats and Republicans 51, plus the upper hand in what will likely be a very expensive Jan. 5 runoff election in Georgia, pitting Democrat Raphael Warnock against Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler. At press time Georgia Sen. David Perdue had just above 50% of the vote in his three-person race, which would allow the Republican to avoid a runoff if it holds. 
While Democrats predicted that Republicans would lose as many as 20 House seats, it hasn’t come to pass. The GOP’s leadership in the lower chamber now says they project to gain roughly a dozen seats, shrinking the Democratic majority substantially. The long-promised “blue wave” dissipated in the face of savvy recruitment and relentless fundraising orchestrated by House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy. New candidates, many of them women, and several black or Latino, pulled off major upsets for the House Republicans.
But everyone’s focused on the big race. Within days, maybe hours, the presidential contest will be settled. That’s hardly too long to wait, and it would be irresponsible not to. Let candidates and their poll watchers and lawyers ensure that election authorities complete their task appropriately so that every legal ballot is counted.
There have been precious few acts of bipartisan grace lately, but we need one now, in the nick of time. Both sides must put the good of the country ahead of all else and make certain the election is buttoned up quickly, fairly and by the rulebook.

2020/11/04,"To Cope With Covid, the World’s Poor Need Debt Relief",Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/to-cope-with-covid-the-worlds-poor-need-debt-relief-11604535612,"The Covid-19 pandemic has taken lives and disrupted livelihoods in every corner of the globe. It has knocked more economies into simultaneous recession than at any time since 1870. According to World Bank estimates, in its first year it may push up to 150 million people into extreme poverty, ending two decades of steady progress on poverty reduction. 
The current crisis stands in contrast to the recession of 2009, when much of the damage fell on financial assets and advanced economies were hit harder than developing countries. This time the economic downturn is much broader and deeper, and it has had an outsize impact on the poorest countries and the poorest people within each country, adding to inequality. It has hit workers whose jobs are unsteady or undocumented, and many of the most vulnerable. 
The World Bank Group has moved rapidly to deploy its full financial capacity. We are on track to commit a record $160 billion over 15 months, and 40% of this amount was committed in the first six months. Our funding helps developing countries tackle the health, economic and social impacts of the pandemic. But even with the World Bank Group delivering massive positive net flows, the poorest countries need much more help. 
For the most impoverished countries, the crisis and associated economic shutdowns came at a moment of particular peril. In 2019 almost half of all low-income countries were assessed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to be either in debt distress or at a high risk of it. With the pandemic, the debt burden has gotten much heavier due to the devastating contraction in output, remittances and family income across the developing world. If this mounting debt goes unaddressed, it could lead to a lost decade for the world’s poorest people. 
To create a recipe for recovery and growth, five ingredients are urgently needed—a sustained debt-service suspension, deep debt-burden reduction, fuller creditor participation, a level playing field to resolve debt crises, and debt transparency to protect the people. On their part, the developing countries themselves also need to take steps to ensure transparent and sustainable national policies that support the poor. 
A good first step, adopted by the Group of 20, is a debt-service suspension by official bilateral creditors, which took effect on May 1 after a call from IMF Director Kristalina Georgieva and me. It allowed the poorest countries to use scarce resources to fund their pandemic response instead of debt payments. Yet relief so far has been less than anticipated because not all creditors participated. Bondholders and other private creditors have generally continued to collect full repayments throughout the crisis while China’s participation was partial in scope. Recent steps taken by China to enhance its engagement hold promise.
Participants at this month’s G-20 summit are likely to urge more creditors to suspend debt payments. This is welcome, but the suspension provides only temporary debt relief, postponing payments but not reducing the ultimate debt burden. For people in the poorest countries, there’s no light at the end of the tunnel—only more government debt. 
Kicking the can down the road should not be an option. G-20 creditors should seek timely and meaningful debt relief for distressed borrowers, through both lower interest rates and actual write-downs in some cases. The common framework reached by the G-20 should avoid repeating the “extend and pretend” approach that delayed recovery after previous debt crises. The most impoverished countries need permanent fiscal space to encourage new investment and create greener, more inclusive growth. 
G-20 governments should instruct and create incentives for all their public bilateral creditors, and forcefully encourage the private creditors under their jurisdiction, to participate fully in debt relief efforts. For now, too many creditors in G-20 countries are continuing to take payments. 
The rationale for reducing the debt of the poorest countries is clear, but there’s no existing bankruptcy process to allow speedy and equitable workouts. Instead the current playing field is tilted to favor creditors, including the vulture variety, over poorer borrowers. It leaves no viable escape from poverty for the people of the debtor countries. 
Given the severity of the crisis, debt restructurings need to reduce the amount owed and should be reached with less litigation and more transparency regarding their terms. This may require legislation in the G-20’s major capitals to reconcile better their public intentions to support the poorest countries with laws that work against debt reduction.
The resistance to debt reduction and transparency is intense. Airtight nondisclosure agreements often protect contracts, leaving their terms secret. Transparency is the only way to balance the interests of the people with the interests of those signing the debt and investment contracts. G-20 countries should require their public creditor institutions to disclose all debt contracts and make refinancing agreements public. 
Developing-country governments must play their part. They need to request debt relief from their creditors. Borrower governments should also refuse nondisclosure clauses and make all their debt dealings transparent, as well as their spending. They need to adopt national policies that are fiscally sustainable, and which actively benefit the poor. 
These steps can help avoid a major setback for development and help people in poverty-stricken countries break out of the devastating economic cycle that sovereign debt crises bring.

2020/11/04,The Fog of Worship With Facemasks,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fog-of-worship-with-facemasks-11604535569,"I’ve never minded wearing eyeglasses to see distances, as I must. Contact lenses always felt too invasive, while the potential side effects of vision-correction surgery frightened me. 
Never, that is, until the coronavirus era. It became clear, so to speak, during a recent Sunday Mass. Because I wear a mask to church, I have about a quarter-minute of altar visibility before breathing renders my spectacles useless. Thus I remove them when seated in the pews and focus on listening to the homily.
This isn’t the problem, at least not to me. Father Byrne, a Jesuit priest who taught me when I was in high school, had a saying for his Latin students: Trust your ears. He meant the eyes can deceive more readily than the ears, so go with what you hear when it conflicts with what you see. 
I’ve taken this lesson to heart during the pandemic. Listening sightless to the Liturgy of the Word can be more of a spiritual feature than a bug. Undistracted by sight, I don’t merely hear; I listen. It’s the Liturgy of the Eucharist where I ran into trouble.
When it came time for the Communion Procession, I put my glasses back on and took my place in line. The altar amble took about 15 seconds, and, on receiving the Eucharist, two thoughts entered my mind. First, God is good. Second, as Steve Winwood, then of—fittingly—Blind Faith, put it, I can’t find my way home.
Through fogged-up lenses, what once was familiar suddenly seemed sinister. The serpentine ropes cordoned off socially distant rows with praetorian efficiency, but also duped the dim-sighted in a forest of pew after empty wooden pew.
Panicking, I committed to the wrong row as I lost my way in the fog, instantly realizing “right church, wrong pew” is more than an idiom. This was certain when the iPhone I’d counted on for dead reckoning wasn’t on the bench where I expected it to be. I felt like Henry Fonda picking strawberries in “On Golden Pond,” the moment he realized he was lost.
A kinder, older parishioner guided me back to my original seat. He seemed to enjoy applying the “do a good turn daily” script by helping someone so seemingly able-bodied across the proverbial street. Nor was it the day’s last lesson in humility.
Two rows behind me was my good friend Greg, the sharp-witted type you hope doesn’t see you when you trip on the street. He witnessed everything, and whispered to me a prayer from the Irish-Catholic hymnal: Get your, ahem, stuff together.
I have never experienced the fog of war, but I have endured the fog of worship. I wouldn’t wish it on anybody.

2020/11/04,The Covid-19 Election,Wonder Land,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-covid-19-election-11604535488,"If you visit the websites of the New York Times or the Washington Post to look at the results of the exit polling conducted Tuesday by Edison Research, you will find questions related to race, sex, inequality, ethnic heritage, health care and the economy. You won’t find this question: How important to your vote was the impeachment of President Trump?
Nor will you find any questions about Russian collusion, the Steele dossier, the Mueller investigation or Ukraine. Which is odd, insofar as battalions of reporters from those newspapers and the rest of the media pushed such “narratives” nonstop for more than three years to defeat this presidency. Sure would be nice to know how many people bought them.
After all that, the 2020 presidential election comes down to a photo-finish, though the horses’ noses are frozen a foot from the finish line as we await a final call from various secretaries of state, litigants and likely the Supreme Court.
We are in this mess for one reason: the Covid-19 pandemic.
If it hadn’t been for Covid, this would have been a normal election, with Donald Trump’s policy record producing a second term and rioting in the streets. Some may say political rioting isn’t normal, but it has become routine for progressive Democrats since Mr. Trump won four years ago.
The coronavirus produced the two things that are the cause of the mess we’re in this week: a Trump vulnerability for Joe Biden to run on, and the mail-in voting fiasco.
Mr. Biden seized on the main political anomaly of the past seven months: While governors from both parties got positive ratings for their handling of the virus, President Trump did not. And for just one reason: Their pandemic press conferences were about the virus. His were about him, causing an avoidable erosion of public support.
Absent this self-inflicted wound, Mr. Biden would have had to run on his only other issue, Mr. Trump’s personality and character. Not implausible, but a harder sell. But then the mass adoption of mail-in voting made Mr. Biden’s job easier. This pandemic-driven novelty is an experiment we should never repeat.
According to the NBC News exit poll, people who voted in the final week selected Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden by 54% to 36%. Feel free to call this sour grapes, but allowing such ludicrously early mail-in voting could as easily damage a future Democratic president. This is an election, not a preset Apple Wallet payment.
For months, Mr. Biden ran a rope-a-dope campaign, showing next to nothing about the party policy issues developed by his famous trainer, Bernie Sanders —until the last debate and “I would transition away from the oil industry, yes.”
That may have been a tactical error, but it was a fact relevant to voters’ calculations about their economic future in states such as Pennsylvania and Texas. That Mr. Biden couldn’t duck it through Election Day is, well, the reason we have campaigns.

Coronavirus infections surged in some states in the election’s final two weeks. Possibly that lent support to Mr. Biden’s criticism of the president’s virus management. On the other hand, voters absorbing the case surge, such as Nevada casino workers, also had to consider the personal economic costs of reimposed business shutdowns, as was being reported in Europe. They had reason to believe Mr. Biden would support resumed shutdowns.
Allowing people to vote so many weeks before a campaign ends produces a politics defined by robotic partisanship rather than a focused judgment about the consequences of one’s vote.
We all keep talking about the awful uniqueness of 2020, and with the year ending, it’s time to consider the lessons of how poorly prepared the American system was for two major predictable events like the pandemic and the voting challenge.
Amid AIDS, SARS, MERS, Zika and Ebola, virologists have warned for decades about a rampant viral pandemic. It came, and we just let it roll over us, with experts such as Anthony Fauci falling back on quarantine strategies barely upgraded from 100 years ago.
Even now, despite a lost school year and historic economic ruin, the presumably best minds here and in Europe haven’t produced anything resembling a plausible risk-benefit strategy between closings and openings or fatalities and others’ survival. Now we are about to drag a presidential election through a legal swamp because of an experimental mail-in voting system whose weaknesses were predicted, not least by the postal service itself.
Just as human nature reimposed itself when people resisted overly broad mask mandates, don’t feign shock when human nature suspects that ineptitude or fraud has been committed beneath this election’s collapsing avalanche of mailed ballots. The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Michigan Wednesday to let it observe the opening of mailed-in ballots. At the least.
By the way, looking at the excitement of this year’s historic voter turnout, remind me again why the U.S. should abolish the Electoral College. It’s a proven system of deep political engagement and America’s great quadrennial pageant. If, in 2020, we don’t debauch it forever.

2020/11/04,Trump and Biden Go to Election Overtime,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-biden-go-to-election-overtime-11604534055,"The presidential race isn’t over, though Joe Biden has a more direct path to victory. As the sun set on Nov. 4, his lead in the Upper Midwest hadn’t grown large enough to prevent recounts or legal challenges. The result in Pennsylvania, meantime, was as clear as a glass of old Lake Erie.
Mr. Biden’s case is simple: Some analysts have called Arizona for him already. Ballots reported Wednesday from Milwaukee and Detroit, in particular, seem to have put him over the top in Wisconsin and Michigan. If that holds, add Nevada and it gets him to 270 in the Electoral College, regardless of what happens in Pennsylvania.
But some of the margins are as thin as a paper ballot. At last check, Mr. Biden led Wisconsin by 20,000 votes, or 0.6 percentage point. Mr. Trump plans to seek a recount. Wisconsin’s 2016 recount barely moved the needle, adding mere hundreds of votes to each side. Still, crazy things have happened: The Thursday after a 2011 election, a Waukesha County clerk announced that 14,000 votes were missed, because she’d failed to click “save” on her computer.
In Michigan, Mr. Biden was up by 67,000, or 1.2 percentage point. There Mr. Trump’s campaign said Wednesday it had sued because Republicans hadn’t been “provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process.” The lawsuit seeks a pause of vote processing and a chance to review ballots already completed.
Team Trump insists that Arizona will still flip to its column as outstanding ballots break for the President. It wouldn’t be the first time a TV network had to retract a call. If Mr. Trump pulls it off, while holding Georgia and North Carolina, then winning Pennsylvania would take him over the top. The Trump campaign also said it sued in Pennsylvania because its observers were kept too far from the counting.
The chances it could break Mr. Trump’s way aren’t zero, but his early morning Wednesday speech, declaring a premature victory in Pennsylvania, was the wrong message. Before the election, Mr. Biden’s supporters said they were more likely to vote by mail, so a “blue shift” was expected as those ballots were tabulated. Mr. Trump went on to warn about “fraud” and also tweeted that “they are trying to STEAL the Election.”
Votes that were validly cast must be counted, however excruciatingly long it takes. This isn’t fraud, no matter what Mr. Trump might say. By the same token, ballots that were not cast according to state law—whether they arrived too late, were missing required signatures or secrecy envelopes, or had other defects—must be rejected. This isn’t voter suppression, no matter what Mr. Biden might say.
There are real counting questions to be raised, particularly if it all comes down to Pennsylvania, which is taking Florida’s crown for voting dysfunction. The sluggish counting was inevitable, since state law says officials can’t start processing piled-up mail ballots until Election Day. The state’s highest court also suspended the legal deadline for ballots to arrive, so votes can keep showing up in the mail through Friday.
That ruling is subject to review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Officials have been advised to track late ballots separately, in case they’re invalidated. It’s too bad the High Court couldn’t settle this question last month, when it split 4-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the liberals. It’d be an awful bit of karma for the 2020 election to wind up back on his desk.
What matters ultimately is the rule of law. As long as the judiciary follows it, neither candidate will have cause to claim an illegitimate outcome. If either side’s supporters take to the streets, Messrs. Trump and Biden have an obligation to calm them. Amid fears of unrest, shops in Midtown Manhattan and other major cities are boarded up. What a sad sight to behold in the United States.
America’s experiment with mass mail voting was forced by the pandemic, but it’s turning out to be a brush with chaos that shouldn’t be repeated. The task for this year is to finish the job by the book: Ignore overheated rhetoric, let state and local officials complete the count, and trust in the rule of law.

2020/11/04,Illinois Tax Repudiation,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/illinois-tax-repudiation-11604534003,"The U.S. electorate Tuesday declined to endorse sweeping progressive change, and that sentiment extended even to deep-blue Illinois. Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, supported by liberal luminaries like Sen. Dick Durbin, exhorted voters to pass a referendum that would repeal the state’s 4.95% flat income tax to allow for higher top rates. Voters declined.
Like other progressive defeats across the country, this one was more marked than polling might have suggested. Gov. Pritzker ran on the “fair tax” in 2018 and a March 2020 poll showed 65% support. But the measure was defeated 45% to 55% as a critical mass of Democratic voters broke with the party’s state leadership.
The state Legislature had passed tax changes set to go into effect if the referendum succeeded. The rate would have risen 2.8 percentage points, to 7.75%, on income above $250,000 for individuals and couples. For individuals earning $750,000, a 7.99% rate would kick in. For income under $250,000, the rate would be cut by a fraction of a percentage point. 
Yet the usual rhetoric about only raising taxes on “the rich” fell flat. Perhaps voters recognized that it would hurt Illinois’ already-flagging competitiveness, and that lifting the flat-rate restriction was an invitation for union-dominated Springfield to ratchet up rates again and again to pay for its fiscal mismanagement. The Tax Foundation says that in 2017 only two states had higher unfunded pension liabilities than Illinois.
The strong performance of Senate Republican candidates nationwide also means that a federal bailout aimed at propping up unsustainable state budgets is unlikely. The Democrats at the helm of Illinois’ sinking fiscal ship may be running out of options short of sustainable public-sector reform.

2020/11/04,A Pelosi-Schumer Defeat,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-pelosi-schumer-defeat-11604533926,"Besides media pollsters, the biggest immediate election losers on Tuesday were Democratic Congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Americans diminished Speaker Pelosi’s House majority and appear to have kept Republicans in control of the Senate as a brake on the left’s agenda.
The biggest news is that Mitch McConnell is likely to return as Senate Majority Leader to torment Democratic dreams for two more years. The GOP lost seats in Colorado and Arizona but gained one in Alabama. Republican Senators Joni Ernst in Iowa, Susan Collins in Maine and Steve Daines in Montana prevailed, and Thom Tillis is leading in North Carolina. 
Democrats poured literally hundreds of millions of dollars into races against Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and in Kentucky against Mr. McConnell that they lost by double-digits. Democrats seem to believe their own progressive pieties that money is destiny in politics. 
Democrat Gary Peters will likely hold onto his seat by a hair, but Iraq war veteran John James outperformed President Trump and made a Michigan Senate race competitive for the first time in many years. The two races in Georgia could head to runoffs in January, but Republicans will be favorites.
A GOP Senate would mean the end of the Biden-Bernie Sanders “unity” agenda. No death to the legislative filibuster, no new U.S. states, no Supreme Court packing, no confiscatory tax increases, no Green New Deal. If Mr. Biden wins and he wants to get something done, he would have to go through Mitch the Knife.
Mrs. Pelosi will keep her majority, but much reduced from 232-197. The GOP flipped two seats in South Florida amid a surge of Hispanic turnout and toppled 15-year Rep. Collin Peterson in western Minnesota. Republicans had picked up a net five seats by Wednesday afternoon and could gain as many as 12 or 13. They regained seats they’d lost in 2018 in Cedar Rapids, Charleston (S.C.), and Oklahoma City. 
Democrats also seem headed for defeat in New York’s Staten Island and trail in districts in Long Island and upstate New York. Republicans were also leading in Virginia around Richmond, exurban Chicago and two districts in Pennsylvania that Democrats flipped in 2018 after the state Supreme Court redrew the map in their favor.
These GOP gains will reduce Mrs. Pelosi’s legislative running room and perhaps test her party control. Her strategy of refusing to compromise on a Covid-19 relief bill may have cost seats, and now she’ll have a harder time getting a blue-state and union bailout through the Senate. If Mr. Biden wins, the GOP will be better poised to retake the House in 2022.
One of Tuesday night’s big stories was how Republicans gained ground among minorities. One reason is they made more of an effort at outreach, especially at their August convention. The GOP message of economic opportunity resonated with minority entrepreneurs and workers as Democrats stood for government lockdowns and handouts. And who would have thought that immigrants who fled socialism in Venezuela and violence in Central America would oppose those scourges here?
Democrats have refashioned themselves into a party of coastal elites and government unions with a progressive agenda that many middle-class Americans dislike. This includes banishing fossil fuels, abolishing state right-to-work laws and a pointless partisan impeachment.
They may have saved a few seats by fear-mongering about pre-existing health conditions for the third election in a row, but even Republicans might eventually figure out they need a response to that one. Regardless of whether Joe Biden wins the White House, the Democratic left lost America.

2020/11/04,Racial Thunder Out of California,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/racial-thunder-out-of-california-11604533888,"Democracy can be surprising, and on Tuesday voters in California killed an effort to reintroduce race-based preferences in state education, hiring and contracts. This rejection of identity politics in one of America’s bluest and most diverse states should echo around America, not least at the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Californians voted down Proposition 16, a ballot measure that would have repealed this provision in the Golden State constitution: “The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.”
Even more astounding, and though it could change as the last votes are counted, the 56.1% to 43.9% margin of victory for keeping the non-discrimination language in the state constitution is larger than the 54.5% to 45.5% when voters added it in 1996. The support for keeping that ban has to shock progressives: A Berkeley IGS Poll before the vote found a third of African-American saying No to Prop 16.
The proposition was supported by almost the entire California political and business establishment; it sailed through a legislature distracted by Covid-19; it gathered steam as a response to racial injustice following the death of George Floyd in the hands of Minneapolis police; and the Yes side raised more than $20 million to the No side’s $1.7 million. As if this weren’t enough, the No on 16 movement was falsely accused of pushing white supremacy.
Still it failed. And as welcome as it will be for Californians to keep their state officially colorblind, it may also help with two big cases about the use of race in college admissions that could end up at the Supreme Court. These cases involve the use of race at Harvard and Yale in a way that discriminates against more qualified applicants—especially Asian-Americans.
The fictional Mr. Dooley said the Supreme Court follows the election returns. In his 2007 plurality opinion in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, Chief Justice John Roberts made clear his position that “the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” 
But the Chief is also leery of major Court decisions that are 5-4. The addition of Justice Amy Coney Barrett now opens the possibility of a 6-3 majority. The clear rejection of racial preferences in California ought to give the Justices even more encouragement to have the courage of their convictions when the Harvard or Yale case arrives at the Court. Maybe America’s future isn’t balkanization by racial and ethnic identity after all.

2020/11/05,America Chooses Divided Government,Declarations,https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-chooses-divided-government-11604620220,"Divided nation, divided outcome. Votes are still being counted, nothing is certain, but it looks as if Joe Biden will win the presidency, closely. The Republicans will hold the Senate, closely, and pick up some seats in the House. A moderate outcome: divided government. 
Or so it seems. It’s all so close. 
The aftermath could get rocky. It is right and reasonable to request recounts in close races where the legal requirement is met, and it looks as if there may be several of them. This will take time. Fine, get it right, protect the integrity of the system. 
There’s nothing wrong with court challenges in the face of evidence of serious and broad malfeasance. But the emphasis must be on real evidence, not drummed-up drama and trying to throw a spanner into the works because you don’t like where things are going. 
It looks to be a long slog. Will some mess and incompetence be uncovered on state levels? Probably. Will we see some mischief appear to have been done in this city or that county? Probably. As in every election. “Landslide Lyndon,” “Vote early and often for Curley”—these are part of our political vocabulary for a reason. Mayor Richard J. Daley is still believed to have put JFK over the top in Illinois in 1960 with the votes of the dead. A certain amount of misbehavior is in our genes, and in democracy’s. Elections are human enterprises. 
But there’s a point at which we have to remember there are limits to all inquiries. Richard Nixon in 1960 didn’t challenge what had been done to him when the cemeteries went strong for JFK. He thought it wouldn’t be good for the country.
Do those involved understand that turning this election into a political street fight could result in literal fighting in the streets? Oh, for a president who could say something like, “Let’s let the system do its work in a hard election shaped by changed rules during a pandemic. Let’s trust in honest outcomes and see where we are at the end. For now from me a simple vow, to stick to tradition and respect the decision of the people.” Instead the president, as this is written is screaming on Twitter about “Voter Fraud,” “STOP THE COUNT,” “secretly dumped ballots.” He vows, based on nothing, to go to the Supreme Court. He ends as he began, playing with fire.
We will have to keep our cool and see to it that the law prevails.
Some small thoughts, an observation and one cause for joy. 
We focus on personas, but policies are often decisive in politics, and surely were this year. One way to say this is to ask a question: What happened between the mighty blue wave of 2018, when a triumphant Democratic Party gained 41 House seats and seven governorships, and the 2020 election, which had no blue wave?
Lots of things, but one was a year of Democratic presidential debates, in which week after week the party painted itself as deeply progressive. The candidates were down with identity politics, would ban private health insurance, were for essentially open borders. I wrote wonderingly after the first debate that the entire party seemed to have picked itself up and placed itself down outside the mainstream and apart from the center. 
They were to the left of their own base. Joe Biden was the base’s man, and he won. But the party had already been tagged.
America in 2020 was not in a progressive mood. From a state-level political professional: “The fear of the left, packing the court, big tax increases, AOC as the face of the party and the group Biden had to answer to. He didn’t have a Sister Souljah moment. Bill Clinton would have.” She believed if Mr. Biden had, it would have increased his margin. 
Democrats surely pay a big price for AOC and “The Squad” and the woke, who are not members of the Democratic coalition but a wrecking ball within it. 

Another part of the story: Not only do the elites not understand the electorate, and the press does not understand the electorate, and the pollsters don’t understand the electorate, but neither of the two parties understands the electorate. And that’s their job! But they don’t understand their own voters. Most Democrats were shocked at the president’s support among Hispanics. Why didn’t they know how that key group within their coalition was seeing the world? Most Republican political professionals were expecting a big blue wave. Instead Trump supporters pretty much stayed. How could they get it so wrong? “Shy Trump voters” doesn’t begin to explain it. This is a real divide, between the professionals and the people, and not a new one. We saw it in 2016. Why does it persist so strongly? 
I took the polls seriously, including the Republican ones, and saw a big Biden win, not a modest one. Only two things gave me pause. One was the big raucous rallies the president had, and Mr. Biden’s not drawing or even trying to draw big crowds. People show their support in lots of ways, and one is taking an entire Saturday, getting to the event site, standing in line in the cold for hours, listening, then trying to get home, sometimes left there without shuttle buses. Mr. Trump’s people sacrificed to see him. Man, that does not mean nothing.
The other was the number of those who told pollsters the past few months that they’re better off now than they were in 2016. It was amazing—in the middle of a pandemic. That probably meant something too.
I end with a just victory. Susan Collins, four-term Republican senator from Maine, was over—in the fight of her life for re-election, never once leading in the polls, written off. She had been brave in 2018 when she backed Justice Brett Kavanaugh after accusations of sexual assault. She took heavy fire back home; her eventual opponent, Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon, vowed to take her out on that vote alone. But what struck me was the care and respect with which Ms. Collins explained her decision on the floor of the Senate. 
Last month she opposed the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett: “In fairness to the American people—who will either be re-electing the President or selecting a new one—the decision on the nominee . . . should be made by whoever is elected on November 3rd.” For this she took fire from conservatives who’d long dismissed her as a Republican in name only. But when everyone else was scared, she took tough votes, tough stands, and shared her thinking.
She puts herself forward with an air of modesty, even a soft-spokenness, as if she wished the camera were on someone else. But have you ever observed one of her re-election campaigns? She crushes her opponents. She’s not meek, she’s Don Corleone. She’s savage. 
She won in a 9-point blowout. 
She deserves the respect of her party. Her male colleagues who so often patronize her, she could teach them a few things. Maybe they’ll ask. It’s 2020, the year of shocks.

2020/11/05,Joe Biden’s Non-Mandate,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-bidens-non-mandate-11604619335,"As the votes continue to be counted in swing states, Joe Biden has the best chance to become the next President. But the closer we inspect the nationwide election returns, the more the result looks like a defeat for the rest of his Democratic Party and especially for the progressive agenda. Mr. Biden would take office without a mandate beyond addressing Covid-19 and not being Donald J. Trump. 
Mr. Biden will win the popular vote, and he may eke out a narrow win in the Electoral College. In essence he’ll have reversed Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 with hair’s-breadth advantages in Wisconsin and Michigan, and perhaps Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona. None of them will be by large margins. He will have vanquished an incumbent President, which is no easy task.
But look down the ballot, or across the country, and Mr. Biden’s potential victory looks remarkably limited and personal. Most new Presidents enter office having swept allies into Congress and statehouses as the public embraces his agenda and vision for America. Certainly this was true of Barack Obama in 2008 and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump in 2016. Mr. Biden had no such coattails.
Democrats lost seats in the House, giving up some of the suburban gains they made in 2018 while continuing to struggle in rural areas. The full results won’t be in for weeks, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi may find her majority cut in half or more to the smallest in 20 years.
Senate control may be determined by a Jan. 5 runoff for two seats in Georgia. But the GOP already looks to have won 50 seats to 48 for Democrats, who had expected to ride public dislike for Mr. Trump into the majority. A GOP Senate may compromise with Mr. Biden around centrist ideas, but the aggressive House agenda of the last two years would die again. 
This result is all the more remarkable given that Democrats had nearly all of the media, Silicon Valley billionaires, and all of the leading cultural figures and institutions helping them. Even the Chamber of Commerce paid protection money. Democrats raised unheard of sums close to $100 million for some Senate races, outspending Republicans by two or three to one. They still could oust only two incumbents and lost one of their own.
The lack of coattails was also evident in the states, where Democrats spent heavily to flip legislatures. Former Attorney General Eric Holder made this his personal project with a goal of dominating the fight over Congressional redistricting next year after the final Census count. He flopped. The GOP flipped both legislative bodies in New Hampshire, despite Mr. Trump’s loss in the Granite State, and Republicans protected their advantage nearly everywhere else. (See more details nearby.) 
There was no blue wave, and certainly no mandate for progressive change. If anything, the fevered Democratic and media anticipation of a “transformational” election drove more voters to turn out to stop it. When Mr. Trump finally focused on the economy and progressive agenda in the last weeks of the campaign, his support rose and lifted Republicans in some places as well. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Biden’s campaign platform boiled down to he’s not Donald Trump, he’ll do a better job fighting Covid-19, and he won’t take away your health care. His TV ads were largely biographical, contrasting his character to Mr. Trump’s. 
Mr. Biden barely mentioned the agenda his aides developed with Bernie Sanders, and the press barely asked him about it. When the former Vice President did finally admit in the last debate that he wanted to “transition” the economy from fossil fuels, his campaign had him scramble to explain it away. 
Mr. Biden does have a mandate to defeat Covid-19, rolling out the vaccines already in the pipeline and setting an example by wearing his mask. He has a mandate not to tweet, not to call the press “the enemy of the people,” and not to make himself the center of attention all the time. He also has a mandate to work across the aisle with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
This could be liberating for Mr. Biden, giving him leverage over a diminished Mrs. Pelosi and the Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing of the Senate Democratic caucus. But he would have to risk upsetting the political left who supported him in hopes that he is the Trojan Horse whose personal contrast with Mr. Trump would usher in a new progressive majority. 
Instead, in their considerable wisdom, the voters may have elected Mr. Biden but they left his party and its radical ideas behind.

2020/11/05,Susan Collins and Majorities,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/susan-collins-and-majorities-11604619306," Susan Collins of Maine is the Senator many conservatives love to disdain, but this week her re-election to a fifth term in a Northeast state may save the Republican majority. It’s a reminder that durable majorities in a diverse America require broad coalitions.
Ms. Collins won because she has an independent profile in a state that looks kindly on that type of politician. She has usually coasted to re-election, but Democrats targeted her this year after she provided the decisive vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Her speech explaining her vote was a tour de force of the Senate’s advice and consent responsibility. The safer vote for re-election would have been no.
Democrats nominated Sara Gideon, Speaker of the Maine House, and the party raised more than $63 million in a state with small TV markets. Ms. Collins raised more than $25 million and was trailing in the polls for months. But on Election Day she won 51% to 42%.
We disagree with Ms. Collins on many issues, not least her vote against the 2017 health-care reform and opposition to Justice Amy Coney Barrett on grounds that her nomination was too close to an election. But these votes help Ms. Collins demonstrate her independence to Mainers who aren’t as conservative as the rest of the country. 
If only Angus King, the state’s Independent Senator who caucuses with Democrats, would ever show some actual independence. With Senate control in the balance, Ms. Collins’s victory in a tough state for Republicans is a crucial barrier to a radical progressive agenda.

2020/11/05,A Democratic Flop in the States,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-democratic-flop-in-the-states-11604619219,"Can donors to former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder’s campaign to take control of statehouses get their money back? Democrats on Tuesday failed to flip any of the GOP legislative chambers they targeted, and Republicans expanded their majorities in some statehouses. 
In 2010 Republicans swept statehouses in states including Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Iowa. This allowed them to draw new Congressional and state maps after the 2010 Census. New GOP statehouse majorities also limited collective bargaining, passed right-to-work legislation (Michigan, Wisconsin), cut taxes (North Carolina, Iowa, Michigan) and expanded school choice (Ohio, Wisconsin, North Carolina), among other reforms. Democrats blamed Barack Obama for ignoring statehouse races. 
Mr. Holder has since launched a half-decade campaign to regain control of statehouses and the post-2020 Census redistricting, and he’s raised a boatload of money to do it. In 2018 and 2019, a backlash against President Trump helped Democrats win governorships in Michigan, Kansas and Wisconsin and “trifectas” (both legislatures and governorships) in Nevada and Virginia.
Democrats went into this election with 39 legislative chambers, 19 statehouses and 15 trifectas. The GOP boasted 59 legislative chambers, 29 statehouses and 21 trifectas. Democrats aimed to flip the legislatures in North Carolina and Arizona and chambers in Texas, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Iowa.
They came up short everywhere. Democrats didn’t pick up a single new chamber or governorship while Republicans won two more trifectas in Montana and New Hampshire by flipping the governorship in the former and both legislative chambers in the latter. Oh, and Republicans expanded legislative majorities in Florida and North Carolina. 
Some races in Arizona are still too close to call, but an independent commission will draw its new maps and GOP Gov. Doug Ducey can stop Democrats from turning the state into California without the beach. Voters in Michigan also recently approved a referendum creating redistricting commissions. Republicans can nonetheless continue to use their statehouse majorities to advance more reforms and set examples of sound governance. 
Democrats are blaming their statehouse rout on GOP gerrymanders in 2010. But Democrats gerrymandered maps after 2000, which didn’t stop Republicans from flipping 24 chambers in 2010 amid a voter backlash against Democrats in Washington. Democrats failed this year because voters again revolted against progressive governance.
Note also that liberal state judges in North Carolina ordered new non-gerrymandered state maps to be used for this election. Republicans nonetheless picked up four state House seats. Texas’s House map was also redrawn by judges under the Voting Rights Act.
A larger problem for Democrats is their voters have become increasingly concentrated in the cities and on the coasts. As a result, their policies and message have become increasingly targeted at progressive elites. Democrats gained some ground in the suburbs and heartland in 2018, but they lost in many of these areas this year. One suggestion: Maybe try a more moderate message than defund the police.

2020/11/05,"Oh, Money Buys Elections?",Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/oh-money-buys-elections-11604619065,"How many crisp, green Ben Franklins did Democrats light on fire trying to sweep the elections? The three most expensive congressional campaigns ever, according to preliminary data at OpenSecrets.org, were this year’s Senate races in North Carolina, Iowa and South Carolina, all of which the GOP appears to have held, though the first still hasn’t been called.
The figures aren’t final, but at last count the Democratic candidates in those states raised $200 million. That includes $108 million in South Carolina, as Jaime Harrison broke the all-time record. Add $88 million for Kentucky, where Democrats fantasized about taking out Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In those four states alone, the Democratic contenders outraised the Republicans by a combined $116 million.
Overall, the 2020 elections will cost $14 billion, Open Secrets projects. That might sound like a big number, but it’s in the realm of what Americans spend on sports drinks during an 18-month political campaign. Democrats typically equate money in politics with corruption. But this year they dominated the money game, up and down the ballot, while placing some bad bets. Mr. McConnell is winning by 21 points. South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham is up 10.
Democratic donors must suffer from chronic Beto O’Rourke Syndrome. That’s a reference to one of 2018’s big-spending campaigns, when Mr. O’Rourke raised $79 million but lost to Senator Ted Cruz. A few weeks ago, Mr. O’Rourke was pleading for Joe Biden to dump money into Texas, instead of spending “a kajillion dollars in Pennsylvania.” With a few ballots left to count, Mr. Trump is winning Texas by six points.
The typical case of Beto Syndrome goes like this: A dynamic Democrat in a red or purple state tells the moneybags that it’s finally extinction time for a Republican dinosaur. The fundamentals are forgotten. But incumbency matters, and Kentucky is going for Mr. Trump by 27 points. In 2004 the GOP beat Democratic Majority Leader Tom Daschle, but that was in South Dakota, which went for George W. Bush by 21 points.
Who can we diagnose with Beto Syndrome? Mike Bloomberg pledged to spend $100 million to topple Donald Trump in Florida. In late October, his super PAC reportedly added $15 million in Ohio and Texas. Mr. Trump held them all, and being seduced by Texas is a sign of the Beto affliction.
The Democrats’ Senate Majority Pac reported $1 million-plus donations from Reed Hastings of Netflix, Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn, James Simons of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, and Jonathan Gray of Blackstone Group. It spent $5 million in South Carolina, $36 million in North Carolina and $41 million in Iowa, per the early Open Secrets tallies. Future Forward USA, with megabucks from Facebook founder Dustin Moskovitz, spent $11 million trying to unseat Texas Senator John Cornyn, who’s winning by 10 points.
That’s the story of 2020: Democrats had the cash, the media, and even the polls, but it turned out that they didn’t have the voters. The usual progressive complaint that money buys elections looks sillier than ever.

2020/11/05,Another Election Goes to Court,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/another-election-goes-to-court-11604618993,"Whoever first quipped “It’s all over but the counting” forgot about the lawyers. Over the past year, Democrats and their allies marched through state after state in an unprecedented legal campaign to upend longstanding rules of election administration. The result is more uncertainty than ever over the basic rules of voting, and an increased likelihood that races will have to be called by the courts. Although it’s too early to say for certain, that may include the presidential election.
The battle lines are being drawn in states President Trump needs to win. Pennsylvania provides a typical illustration. In 2019 the state overhauled its election code to allow everyone to vote by absentee ballot. What had been a relatively restrictive regime, with early deadlines and limited availability, was transformed into one of the most liberal in the nation, requiring only that ballots be received by the statewide voting deadline, 8 p.m. on Election Day.
Even that wouldn’t hold. After three lawsuits to extend the deadline struck out this summer, the Pennsylvania Democratic Party hit a home run on the fourth at-bat. What changed was that the secretary of state, charged with defending state law, switched sides to support her own political party. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the ballot-receipt deadline, established by state law, violated the state constitution’s “Free and Equal Election Clause” and legislated a three-day extension along with a presumption of timeliness for unpostmarked ballots received by Friday. It dismissed out of hand arguments that the U.S. Constitution’s Elections and Electors clauses vest exclusive authority in state legislatures to set the rules of federal elections that can’t be rewritten by state judges or executive-branch officials.
The U.S. Supreme Court split evenly on requests by the state Republican Party and the GOP-controlled Legislature to block the lower-court ruling—effectively denying them. But both have asked the court to review the case on the merits, and the Trump campaign filed a motion on Wednesday to join that case as a party. If Pennsylvania is close, the Biden campaign will join the other side, creating a 2020 reincarnation of Bush v. Gore. 
We’ve come to this pass because of Democratic politicians’ recklessness and the Supreme Court’s timidity. Democrats knew from the beginning that it was risky for state courts to shift the rules of federal elections, because voters might rely on state-court decisions later overturned under federal law. The justices also could have avoided the problem by deciding the issue before Election Day, when voters still had the opportunity to get their ballots in on time according to the rules. 
In this case, Chief Justice John Roberts’s inclination to duck politically charged cases may prove self-defeating. If the court has to step in now, after the votes have been cast and counted, a political storm could become a hurricane.
Republicans filed two Election Day lawsuits in Pennsylvania challenging local election officials’ disparate treatment of defective mail-in ballots. While state law doesn’t permit mail-in voters to be notified of defects with their ballots—doing so would interfere with the timing and confidentiality of the counting process—officials in several counties apparently contacted voters to allow them to cure defects. The problem, aside from violating state law, is that this treats voters differently depending on where in the state they live, in contravention of equal-protection principles. It’s little different from the gerrymandered recount the high court rejected in Bush v. Gore.
The backdrop in Arizona is a long-running lawsuit by the Democratic National Committee challenging the state’s requirement (shared by most states) that voters cast their ballots in assigned precincts, along with its prohibition on “ballot harvesting,” the collection of ballots by parties outside the voter’s family or household. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Democrats and enjoined both policies in 2016, but the Supreme Court blocked the injunction a day later, with no recorded dissents. 
The litigation dragged on. After a 10-day trial, a district court held that neither of these policies violates the Voting Rights Act. The Ninth Circuit reversed, but it stayed its own decision, anticipating that the Supreme Court would do so if it didn’t. The Supreme Court agreed last month to hear the state’s appeal, but it has yet to schedule arguments in the case. Meanwhile, Democrats stand ready to challenge the disqualification of wrong-precinct votes if that’s necessary to nudge up the numbers. 
The presidential race may require legal decisions resolving such issues, as well as recounts and all the additional questions they implicate, to be decided in as many as half a dozen states. Manual recounts may be requested in several states, adding additional delays to the overall process. The Trump campaign has already filed lawsuits challenging various aspects of ballot handling and counting in Michigan and Georgia; suits in Nevada and Arizona may follow. Every case will have to be decided before Dec. 8, the federal statutory “safe harbor” deadline for states to appoint elector slates, or, at the absolute latest, by Dec. 14, when the Electoral College votes. 
The media is already accusing the Trump campaign of attempting to litigate its way to victory, but practically every issue in play arises from the Democrats’ march through the courts in the run-up to Election Day. For all the cries of “disenfranchisement,” both sides agree that every lawful ballot should be counted. But after so many conflicting court decisions over the past year, what’s uncertain now is the law, and there’s no dishonor in asking the courts to say what it is.

2020/11/05,Beijing Strangles Hong Kong Even Tighter,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-strangles-hong-kong-even-tighter-11604618954,"With July’s national security law, China’s Communist Party dismantled Hong Kong’s freedoms and destroyed the “one country, two systems” principle. Now Beijing has announced it will go even further and impose “comprehensive governance” of Hong Kong in the next five years, effectively absorbing the territory into the mainland in violation of the international treaty it signed with Britain in 1984.
Led directly by Xi Jinping, the proposal forms part of China’s next five-year plan and would apply to Macau as well. It specifically threatens Hong Kong’s legal system, emphasizing the need to “implement the central government’s comprehensive jurisdiction over the two [cities], as well as their legal systems and enforcement mechanisms.” It highlights the regime’s wish to “boost Hong Kong and Macau compatriots’ sense of national identity and patriotism . . . as we resolutely prevent and curb external forces from interfering with the two cities’ affairs.”
Hong Kong’s freedoms have been steadily eroded over the past six years by a range of repressive laws and measures. Now Beijing’s wants to destroy any semblance of the island’s autonomy.
In practice, “comprehensive governance” means direct rule. Hong Kong would no longer be different from any mainland city. It could spell the end of democratic elections, a free press, freedom of expression, academic freedom, religious freedom, judicial independence and the rule of law. It could turn Hong Kong into a place of arbitrary detentions, disappearances, torture, forced televised confessions, slave labor, prison camps and executions. It could mean places of worship destroyed or closed, crosses torn down, portraits of Mr. Xi displayed in churches alongside or instead of religious symbols. Not even Hong Kongers’ body parts would be safe, given the regime’s track record of forced organ harvesting. It could make Hong Kong the new Tibet, the new Xinjiang.
The international community should make it clear to Beijing that any move toward direct rule would trigger swift and severe consequences, including the imposition of targeted sanctions. The free world should also work together to offer a lifeline to Hong Kongers who’d like to leave. 
Let this be a wake-up call to those who say we must continue to engage China in good faith. The Chinese Communist Party has clearly demonstrated it will not hesitate to break its word, bully and intimidate to try to get its way. We must not tolerate this.
Whoever wins the election, America’s president must put responding to the erosion of freedom in Hong Kong at the top of his to-do list. Hong Kong has been the front line for the free world. That front line moved to Taiwan in July when the national security law took effect, and Taiwan is now in Mr. Xi’s sights. Failure to make it abundantly clear that Beijing’s most recent proposal will carry grave, long-term consequences would expose Taiwan to further threat—and that would move the front line of the fight for freedom even closer to home.

2020/11/05,They’d Rather Be Canadians,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/theyd-rather-be-canadians-11604618928,"Point Roberts, Wash., is a census-designated place with a population of 1,314 about 45 minutes south of Vancouver, British Columbia. It offers beautiful views of the ocean and mountains. Farming and fishing are popular. There are few scattered businesses, one school, a doctor’s clinic and several parks and trails.
Oh, and one other thing. Some of its residents are fed up with the U.S. and would like their town to be sold or ceded to Canada.
In June 1846 the U.S. and U.K. signed the Oregon Treaty, ending the Oregon border dispute. The new border, at the 49th parallel, cut right through the Tsawwassen Peninsula, with Point Roberts stuck on the American side. If residents want to drive to the U.S. mainland, they must first pass through Canada. There’s no other option.
For a long time, residents didn’t seem to mind. As Vancouver-based Toronto Star reporter Douglas Quan wrote on Oct. 17, their community has been called a “quirk of geography” and America’s “orphan problem child.” Nevertheless, people in Point Roberts considered themselves lucky to live in “safe, sleepy isolation.”
Then Covid-19 struck. The U.S.-Canada border has been closed to “nonessential travel” since March. “Severe border restrictions have essentially choked off Point Roberts, turning it into a ‘ghost town,’ ” Mr. Quan wrote. Businesses that rely on Canadian travel and tourism have taken a huge financial hit. Some Point Roberts parents whose children attend schools in British Columbia have been forced to “put up their kids in homes on the Canadian side of the border.”
Point Roberts locals have been understandably frustrated with the situation. With no end to the pandemic in sight, they want to find an escape hatch from the U.S.—and fast.
Some call it “PRexit”—Point Roberts Exit. Others feel the U.S. should sell or cede the town to their Canadian neighbors. More exposure to beer, back bacon and ice hockey, and a subtle switch from saying “huh” to “eh,” would suit them just fine. 
Probably neither President Trump nor Joe Biden is familiar with what’s going on in Point Roberts. The possibility of selling a small piece of the U.S. to Canada could appeal to Mr. Trump’s “Art of the Deal” persona if he’s re-elected. If Mr. Biden wins, this may help ease some tensions in the town and he could tell Americans that the situation was so grave under Mr. Trump that one of our communities considered leaving our country to go to Canada. The border will remain closed, however, no matter who’s in charge.
Turning Point Roberts, an unincorporated township, into something similar to Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory, could work. It would even intrigue Canada, since conservative-leaning members of Parliament in my country have occasionally mused about the possibility of annexing the Turks and Caicos Islands.
Other—far less likely—options include statehood and independence. A Republic of Point Roberts would recall the wonderful Franco-Belgian bande dessinée series “The Adventures of Asterix,” in which a little village existed under Roman Republican rule even after the main country had been conquered by Julius Caesar. 
With good fortune and a bit of luck, Point Roberts will get past this difficult period and remain an obscure exclave of the American Republic. If not, the door to the Great White North is always open. The more the merrier.

2020/11/05,America Disappoints the New York Times Again,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-disappoints-the-new-york-times-again-11604615710,"This should be a time for humility among people in the media industry as we contemplate another year’s worth of flawed analysis and shattered expectations. Your humble correspondent is no exception. However painful it may be to acknowledge, this column must accept that younger voters are increasingly choosing hard seltzer over beer.
Elsewhere in the press corps the results of this year’s elections are proving to be even more painful, perhaps even excruciating. A New York Times columnist named Charles M. Blow has been taking the news especially hard. Even while acknowledging limitations in preliminary data from exit polls, Mr. Blow reports that he is “still stunned” and writes:
On Twitter, Mr, Blow adds that these numbers are “so personally devastating to me”. Let’s hope he’ll soon be on the road to recovery. But it’s hard to be optimistic because apparently the survey statistics just will not leave him alone. Mr. Blow notes in the Times:
The Times columnist adds a bizarre declaration on Twitter:
For context, those who don’t regularly read the Times should know that like a number of the paper’s columnists, Mr. Blow casually tosses accusations of racism or treason or other offenses at the President of the United States and the roughly half of Americans who support him. Therefore it may be especially painful for Mr. Blow to see that he’s not making the ideological sale with large swathes of the American electorate. 
So in the hallowed Times tradition, he’s decided to blame the voters. “Some people who have historically been oppressed will stand with the oppressors, and will aspire to power by proximity,” concludes Mr. Blow. 
Given how poorly he’s been feeling this week, perhaps voters shouldn’t take the insults personally.
As for Mr. Blow, his self-reporting clearly suggests that he’s not in a good place right now. But perhaps it will take the sting out of reviewing polling results to know that they cannot be trusted. Many national and state polls turned out to be wildly inaccurate in attempting to forecast U.S. voting results. 
Last Saturday economist Casey Mulligan wrote a blog post exploring how the lessons of economics might improve polling and noted that asking people which candidate they expect to win an election has often yielded a more meaningful result than asking for whom they will vote. This gets into the question of whether voters are comfortable being candid about their views with pollsters. Recently the Journal’s Barton Swaim interviewed Trafalgar Group’s Robert Cahaly, who goes to great lengths to tease out honest answers and has lately been reporting more accurate predictions than many large media outlets.
It seems that many of the name brands in survey research don’t go to such lengths. In his prescient Saturday post, Mr. Mulligan wrote:

2020/11/05,Video Games and Your Information Privacy,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/video-games-and-your-information-privacy-11604609719,"The claims made by Dave Aitel and Jordan Schneider in their Oct. 28 op-ed “If You Play Videogames, China May be Spying on You” are speculative and misleading. The authors get facts wrong and overlook Tencent’s commitment to user privacy and data security.
Videogames don’t represent nearly the data risk the authors claim. Games typically don’t collect real-life personal data nor is data used for targeted advertising or content recommendation. And most mobile game publishers don’t have access to sensitive financial data, instead relying on third parties such as Apple and Google to process payments.
The authors also confuse investing with operational control. Tencent supports and invests in U.S. game developers, but we are not the publisher of their U.S. games. And it is the U.S. publisher—not Tencent—that has access to user data and makes content moderation decisions. This is true for our minority investments and the few cases where we have majority stakes. Both types of companies are operationally independent and conduct their own U.S. publishing activities. 
Where we do try to help is with global expansion, especially in China. Through licensing agreements, we have paid billions in fees to our U.S. partners, and we are proud of—and committed to—their growth and contributions to the U.S. economy.
Tencent does publish a handful of its own games in the U.S. such as PUBG Mobile and Arena of Valor. For these games, U.S. user data is retained on servers outside mainland China and is compliant with both the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act.

The U.S. media are very eager to publish unsubstantiated threats to U.S. national security involving companies from China, but they forget to mention that American tech giants are mostly an open book to the U.S. government when it comes to the data they store on international users, as the Fourth Amendment doesn’t apply to them. I learned that recently when a federal judge in Kentucky told me that the data Google (and any other provider) stores about me, a foreign national, in the U.S., should be handed over on request and doesn’t even require a warrant. What might the U.S. government be doing with that data? The rest of the world should be running from U.S. big-tech companies, as they are a personal security risk to world citizens.

2020/11/05,Steel Tariffs Helped the U.S. Steel Industry,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/steel-tariffs-helped-the-u-s-steel-industry-11604609611,"Regarding “Steel Tariffs’ Boost Appears Short-Lived” (U.S. News, Oct. 29): The tariffs worked, lowering the market share of imported steel, increasing domestic capacity-utilization rates, allowing idled facilities to be restarted and encouraging the industry to make billions of dollars of investments in new and upgraded steel facilities. However, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, steel demand and raw steelmaking capacity utilization plunged. American steelmakers were forced to close plants, lay off workers and delay investment activity. But if not for the tariffs, the impact would have been far worse.
The threat of renewed surges in steel imports in the face of the coronavirus shock make the national-security justification for the steel tariffs even more clear. While the steel industry is beginning to recover from the impacts of the pandemic, progress has been slow. The industry remains at risk from growing global steel overcapacity in China and elsewhere, fueled by foreign state-directed investment and subsidies, which distort global steel markets and encourage unfairly traded steel to pour into the U.S. The steel tariffs are necessary to prevent import surges that destroy good-paying manufacturing jobs and undermine a critical U.S. industry.

2020/11/05,South Dakota Needs to Push Mask Wearing,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-dakota-needs-to-push-mask-wearing-11604609493,"Because South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has no opinion on whether people should wear masks while in close proximity to others in public locations, I’d like to share mine: Wear masks while in close proximity to others in public locations. (“Dakotas, Once a Haven, Now See Infections Surge,” U.S. News, Nov. 2)
If that was my opinion only, then I wouldn’t be writing this letter. But it isn’t. Local, state, federal and global health organizations advocate mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing to help reduce the spread of Covid-19. These recommendations aren’t made to shame people or restrict freedoms. They are made to save lives.
Gov. Noem is correct that the virus will spread with or without governmental restrictions. However, there are effective ways to slow the spread, and the government should be encouraging people to slow the spread. Advocating for people to follow evidence-based public-health recommendations will help reduce the burden on our health system and ultimately lower the number of people dying from Covid-19.
The fact that the governor of South Dakota feels “pretty good about where we’re at” is disheartening. I am sure this is an incredibly stressful and difficult time to be a public leader. And in the current political climate, no leader can make decisions that will make all of their constituents happy. But this isn’t about making people happy. This is about protecting the people you serve.
I don’t feel pretty good about where we’re at. Please, everyone, wear masks while in close proximity to others in public locations. There is no shame in doing so.

2020/11/06,The Presidential Endgame,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-presidential-endgame-11604706255,"Perhaps it was inevitable that Donald Trump’s re-election campaign would end as his Presidency began: with the President claiming victory and his frenzied antagonists denouncing him as a would-be fascist. The reality is that the U.S. can and probably will have a normal election outcome regardless of the shouting between now and then.
Mr. Biden is leading in enough states to win the Presidency, and if those votes survive recounts and legal challenges, he will be the next President. But whoever wins needs the other to concede to be able to govern. The result Americans on both political sides should want is one that most people think was decided fairly. 
Mr. Trump has every right to demand recounts if state votes are close, and to go to the courts for relief if there is evidence of fraud. Joe Biden’s lawyers are also in court, and they were for weeks before the election trying to ease mail-in ballot rules. Mr. Biden should also want the recounts and legal process to play out for the sake of his call to heal political rancor.
As for fraud, the Trump campaign will have to prove it to prevail in court. It won’t be enough to charge that Philadelphia is historically corrupt, though it is, or that state election officials are partisan. The Georgia secretary of state is a Republican, by the way, contrary to Mr. Trump’s remarks Thursday night. The vote counting in Arizona and Georgia has seemed professional and transparent.
The same can’t be said of Philadelphia, where the Trump campaign had to go to court so its poll-watchers could observe vote counting. Incredibly, Democratic lawyers opposed that Trump request. This is exactly the wrong way for Democrats to behave, feeding GOP suspicions. The vote-counting standard should be transparency for both sides to ensure public confidence.
The Democratic Pennsylvania Supreme Court also contributed to the mistrust by rewriting state election law to let mailed ballots be counted until Nov. 6. We warned multiple times that this mess could happen, and the U.S. Supreme Court could have helped by intervening. Chief Justice John Roberts refused.
But it’s also important to note that Pat Toomey, the GOP Senator from the Keystone State, says he has seen no evidence of fraud in his state’s counting. We’ve also seen no concrete evidence. The delivery of a batch of votes all for Mr. Biden at one time can be explained by the practice of some jurisdictions to divide and report the votes of each candidate at different times.
The Trump campaign has made a substantive claim that thousands of votes in Nevada failed to meet the state’s residency requirement. That ought to be provable one way or another. If the campaign has other evidence, bring it on and test it in court. 
The suspicions of Trump supporters about all this are fed by the behavior of his opponents over the last four years. Democrats still spread the voter suppression myth about Stacey Abrams’s defeat in Georgia in 2018. Democrats never accepted Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016, and Hillary Clinton still prattles on that the Russians did it. 
So do the media partisans who promoted the Steele dossier and served as an echo chamber for the Russia collusion farce. The FBI’s abuses in 2016 were a genuine scandal that the media would have called out had it been aimed at a Democrat. Instead they treated Rep. Adam Schiff’s lies as gospel. And then New York Times sages puzzle in public about why 70 million Americans again voted for Donald Trump? Look in the mirror, folks.
If Mr. Biden has 270 Electoral College votes at the end of the counting and litigation, President Trump will have a decision to make. We hope in that event he would concede gracefully. He has accomplished a great deal since descending on that Trump Tower escalator in 2015, including his historic first victory and a strong re-election performance when he was supposed to lose in a rout. We’d hate to see that legacy ruined by a refusal to accept the normal transfer of power.
Mr. Trump can rightly say that he helped the GOP save its Senate majority, gain seats in the House, and save the country from a radical progressive agenda. The election results show he has also broadened the GOP appeal to minorities and across middle-class America. His policies broadened prosperity to a forgotten group of Americans, and his willingness to buck conventional wisdom led to a diplomatic breakthrough in the Middle East. His judicial appointments have reshaped the federal courts and will echo through the law for years.
This is a considerable achievement, and it may look even better once Mr. Biden attempts to govern with an angry, impatient left. But Mr. Trump’s legacy will be diminished greatly if his final act is a bitter refusal to accept a legitimate defeat. Republican officials will turn away, and eventually so will the American public that wants to see the election resolved. 
Mr. Trump hates to lose, and no doubt he will fight to the end. But if defeat comes, he will serve himself and his country best by honoring America’s democratic traditions and leaving office with dignity.

2020/11/06,The Jobs Keep Coming,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-jobs-keep-coming-11604706131,"Friday’s labor report showing that employers added 906,000 private jobs in October again beat forecasts. The economy’s resilience is befuddling the pessimists, much as Tuesday’s election results confounded media pollsters.
The jobless rate fell to 6.9% last month from 7.9% in September even as labor force participation ticked up 0.3 percentage points to 61.7%. Total employment rose 638,000 despite a 268,000 decline in government jobs—mostly education and temporary Census. No surprise, schools on remote learning need fewer workers.
Private job growth was broad-based and especially strong in leisure and hospitality (271,000), retail (104,000), construction (84,000), health care and social assistance (79,000) and transportation and warehousing (63,200). As state restrictions have eased, businesses have continued to increase hiring. Grocery and home-improvement stores employ more than they did a year ago. 
Keynesians at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street have continued to predict the economy would fall off a demand cliff without trillions in new government spending. But their forecasts keep missing. The Fed June jobless rate prediction for the end of the year was 9.3%, which it cut to 7.6% in September, but the rate is already 6.9%. Too many people are still out of work, but progress has been remarkable since the government-induced recession. The economy will continue to grow as long as the U.S. avoids policy mistakes, including another lockdown.

2020/11/06,Revolt Against the Illinois Machine,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/revolt-against-the-illinois-machine-11604706049,"There’s nothing like defeat to concentrate the political mind, and congratulations to Illinois voters for shaking Democrats from their high tolerance for corruption. They’ve finally begun to distance themselves from state House Speaker Michael Madigan after years of being joined at the wallet.
Democrats took a beating on Tuesday night, losing four state House seats and a state Supreme Court Justice in a retention election for the first time in state history. The coup de grâce was the overwhelming voter rejection of a progressive tax referendum that Democrats were counting on to hold up their fiscal house of cards. 
Suddenly, eyes are opening in the party about Mr. Madigan, who has been House Speaker for 36 years and Democratic Party chairman for 22. “All across our state—and the advertising told the story—we paid a heavy price for the Speaker’s chairmanship of the Democratic Party,” U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said Wednesday. 
 Gov. J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire who washed away some $56 million of his own money in the losing referendum, was also upset. “The Republicans and the billionaires that sided with them were effectively able to use the speaker as their foil, and that hurt our state’s ability to get things done,” Mr. Pritzker said, adding that Mr. Madigan should step down as party leader.
They never seemed to mind when Mr. Madigan was using the support of public unions to cement Democratic control of Springfield. Democrats have entrenched their legislative majority that has gerrymandered state and House maps, as well as Democratic judges who have repeatedly blocked government reforms including term limits and pension changes.
In return for union support, Mr. Madigan has saddled taxpayers with unsustainable pension obligations, rising property taxes, a shrinking economic base and the country’s worst state credit rating. George Washington Plunkitt of Tammany Hall called this “honest graft.”
But now this corrupt political bargain is being exposed. Over the summer the Justice Department alleged in a deferred prosecution agreement that utility Commonwealth Edison had engaged in a bribery scheme that appeared to implicate Mr. Madigan. ComEd admitted to arranging favors for the House Speaker’s associates in order to win his support for legislation that benefited the utility. 
The corruption probe continues, and the FBI has searched the homes of several people, including one of Mr. Madigan’s former political aides. Mr. Madigan hasn’t been charged and he denies wrongdoing. 
No surprise, Mr. Madigan said Thursday he has no plans to step aside. And the truth is that it probably wouldn’t matter much if he did. Some other entrenched Democrat would take his place, and Illinois’s public-union dominance would continue. 
Democrats are turning on Mr. Madigan because voters have finally figured out his leading role in their state’s economic and fiscal decline. But the real problem is the public union-Democratic machine, and Messrs. Durbin and Pritzker won’t challenge that.

2020/11/06,Fiction’s Been Part of American Democracy,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/fictions-been-part-of-american-democracy-11604704090,"Adam Kirsch notes in “The Fiction of American Democracy” (Review, Oct. 31) that American literature constantly poses “the question that the poet Allen Ginsberg stated . . . ‘America, when will you be angelic?’” We can judge America by its distance from perfection, but we should also recognize the nobility of its ideals, compared with the rest of the world in 1776, and the progress made toward realizing them, compared with the rest of the world today. As poets go, Leonard Cohen reached a more profound place than Ginsberg, with his three-line poem in “Book of Longing” (2006): “oh and one more thing / you aren’t going to like / what comes after America.”
Rick Richman

Without wishing in any way to detract from the achievement of Harriet Beecher Stowe in writing “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” (1851), I wish to bring to your attention the work of Frances Trollope (1779-1863), the English novelist.
Trollope became one of the first novelist either in England or America to expose the evils of slavery to a wide reading public in “Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw” (1836). The plot of the novel made clear the most prominent abuses of the slavery system: the separation of families, the sexual exploitation of female slaves, the brutalizing of the owners themselves and the violence of the lynch law which made those who tried to resist fear for their lives. She explored these subjects with more frank realism than did Harriet Beecher Stowe in her more well-known antislavery novel, which appeared fully 15 years after Trollope’s book. 
Trollope’s slave heroine Juno is no pacifist. Indeed, she resorts to murdering the sadistic overseer Whitlaw, though in the novel Trollope leaves Juno unpunished. Her novel ends with decisive action, violent and illegal, amid disenchantment with the more gradual and philanthropic efforts at coping with slavery. Accused of extravagance and misrepresentation, she was fiercely attacked by the critics, who called “Whitlaw” “an unpleasant and repulsive book.” Today, her novel should be respected for its first and serious treatment of this important subject. Within a year, the book went through three editions and launched her as a pioneer in writing fiction with a social purpose. Along with Harriet Beecher Stowe, she should be recognized for her pathbreaking work.

2020/11/06,Milton Friedman’s Excellent TV Adventure,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/milton-friedmans-excellent-tv-adventure-11604704034,"Regarding William McGurn’s “The Weekend Interview with Bob Chitester: The Man Who Made Milton Friedman a Star” (Oct. 31): Mr. Chitester agrees with Adam Smith, as paraphrased by Mr. McGurn, that “freedom depends crucially on individuals’ personal discipline, which religion often helps supply.” In a 1789 letter President John Adams wrote: “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.”
The essence of morality is the willingness to forego pursuing one’s self-interest if it may be detrimental to the interests of others. We often think of morality in terms of major issues, yet seldom think about morality on lesser issues. Thomas Hobbes said that manners are small morals. The shopping-cart theory posits that a community’s level of morality may be indicated by the number of shopping carts abandoned in parking lots. Those who abandon them are pursuing their own interests, which may be detrimental to the interests of others.
If we are no longer a moral people, we are no longer capable of self-government. Have we become interested in pursuing our interests with no regard for the interests of others?

2020/11/06,Voting Means Earning the Right to Complain,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/voting-means-earning-the-right-to-complain-11604703987,"Regarding Peggy Noonan’s “Raucous 2016 Gives Way to Subdued 2020” (Declarations, Oct. 31): Voting isn’t a sacrament, it’s the grubby duty of democracy. Yes, sometimes that means voting for the lesser of two evils. Your vote isn’t an expression of your heartfelt endorsement of everything a candidate stands for or has ever done, nor is your declining to vote an expression of some higher principle, the way a pacifist might decline to bear arms. It’s an abdication of our very first duty as citizens.
Disdain isn’t an effective stance in a representative democracy—it’s merely self-indulgent. We’re obliged to make a choice.

Ms. Noonan’s winsome deconstruction of Donald Trump (personally) and the Democrats (politically) concludes with a protest vote. But let’s be clear, the radical left cheers every conservative “no” vote or “third-party” vote—especially in closely contested states. Her vote for Edmund Burke may ease her conscience but also may contribute to a Kamala Harris presidency.

2020/11/06,It’s Hard to Get Accurate Numbers on Covid,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-hard-to-get-accurate-numbers-on-covid-11604703931,"Regarding Holman W. Jenkins’s “The Other Media Blackout” (Business World, Oct. 31): There is complexity in assigning a cause of death when there are a number of underlying factors leading to a death. Assigning a single cause of death when there are a number of factors is arbitrary, random and, in the case of the current pandemic, also heavily influenced by political and economic considerations. When coupled with the abnormally high rate of virus deaths due to ignorance, gross mismanagement and criminal incompetence in locked-down old-age homes, veterans’ facilities and cruise ships, meaningful statistics are very hard and probably impossible to come by. 
This year’s total morbidity rates have been higher than expected. It is tempting to attribute this to the effect of the coronavirus, but there would also be a serious flaw in this conclusion. As is often reported during this pandemic, routine health care has suffered greatly among the general public. Overall, doctor visits have been reduced because of fear, telemedicine has often replaced hands-on examinations and hospitals have reduced nonvirus-related admissions, surgery and treatments due to overcrowding and staff illnesses. There has been an appreciable concomitant overall spike in nonvirus-related deaths and even suicides as a result of the pandemic, but not directly caused by the virus bug itself. The coronavirus has been shown to be a highly contagious and lethal virus but accurate statistics have thus far been difficult or impossible to ascertain.

2020/11/06,This Election Was Full of Surprises,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-election-was-full-of-surprises-11604703775,"It was a peculiar election. Not, as was often prophesied, the most epochal election. Even while it’s not over in the true Yogi Berra sense, some unanticipated features are coming into focus.
The first is the unholy mess created by the sudden introduction of mail-in voting in state after state. Nevada’s Democratic governor, Steve Sisolak, called a hurried special session of the Legislature at the end of July, which rushed into law provisions for mailing out ballots to every voter registered in the state. The result swamped Nevada’s ability to count, and since the new law provides that ballots count if they’re received as late as a week after the election, the prospect for irregularities is sky-high. 
Similar problems have plagued vote counts in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania (where Philadelphia has had an unhappy history of voter fraud, leading last May to the conviction of an elections judge on federal bribery charges). On the other hand, 20 years after the Florida recount, the Sunshine State sailed through 2020.
Not since the bitterly contested election of 1824—not even in 2000—has so much confusion and accusation over voting hung in the air in so many places. The 1824 election was thrown into the House and ended with the victory of John Quincy Adams, even though Andrew Jackson had a plurality of both popular and electoral votes. That result instantly became stigmatized as “the corrupt bargain” and doomed Adams’s presidency to four years of futility. The election of 2020 is already taking on the profile of “the stolen election,” with the losing side, regardless of the outcome, ready to accuse the other. If Mr. Biden emerges the winner, there will probably be demands in statehouse after statehouse to erase any tarnish from the result by making mail-in balloting the new normal. 
There have been other surprises. Scandals and accusations, which hurt candidates in 2016, no longer seemed to bother voters in 2020. Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign was seriously damaged by FBI inquiries into her handling of classified emails while secretary of state. This time voters didn’t seem to care about either the president’s impeachment or the Biden family’s links to Chinese and Ukrainian financial interests.
Despite Mr. Trump’s being cast as racist, and race-related protests and riots across the country this summer, he managed to outperform his 2016 showing with minorities. His share of black voters in exit polls rose from 8% to 12%. A September Democracy Fund survey found the president with 21% support among black voters under 45. Mr. Trump’s share of Hispanic men rose from 32% to 36% and Hispanic women from 25% to 28%. But only 58% of white men voted for him, down from 62% four years ago.
The shift in minority voting was nowhere near enough to boost Republican candidates to success in black-majority districts. Baltimore’s Kimberley Klacik, who drew national attention for her two eye-popping campaign videos, has so far recorded only 29% of her district’s vote, an 8-point improvement over the Republican nominee in 2018 against the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. But one black Republican— Byron Donalds in Florida—won a GOP seat, and another, Burgess Owens, is in a tight, yet-to-be-called contest in Utah. John James, in his second race for a Michigan U.S. Senate seat, appears to have lost narrowly to the Democratic incumbent. All told, 24 of 26 black Republicans have lost races for Congress.
Other Republicans did better. Democrats, who picked up 41 House seats and the majority in 2018, predicted 15 more gains in 2020. Instead, by the time the votes are sorted out, they are likely to give back at least 10 seats to Republicans and set up a push for the GOP to regain the House in 2022. This, even though Democratic political-action committees and advocacy groups outspent Republicans by nearly $100 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
In the Senate, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, one of Mr. Trump’s most ardent defenders, easily turned back a challenge from Jaime Harrison, despite Democrats’ lavishing $109 million on Mr. Harrison’s campaign. And despite losses for Sens. Cory Gardner in Colorado and Martha McSally in Arizona, Republicans defeated Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and are on track to hold their other seats, pending at least one January runoff in Georgia, all but guaranteeing they will continue to hold a majority. 
The Republican Senate will neutralize Democratic efforts in the House to enact sweeping progressive agendas. The Equality Act, which Mr. Biden promised to sign to provide “protections for LGBTQ+ individuals” and eliminate “broad religious exemptions,” passed the House in May 2019, but has lain untouched by the Senate ever since—and is likely to stay that way. Likewise the Green New Deal, which the House approved in February 2019, and the Senate voted down a month later. 
Mr. Biden, assuming he emerges as the victor, would no doubt resort to executive actions to promote elements of House legislation. But like Mr. Trump, he would face challenges in persuading courts to uphold them. The frustration of winning the presidency but being able to do so little with it may tempt Democrats into incessant investigations of Trump officeholders by House committees or a Biden Justice Department. But not even Mr. Trump, after his 2016 victory over Mrs. Clinton, made a serious effort to “lock her up.”
A Biden presidency would have more-pressing issues to deal with anyway. The first would surely be the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Biden has promised an executive order mandating face masks on federal property, and his warning in the second presidential debate of a “dark winter” of resurgent Covid-19 has stoked fears that he might attempt to impose some sort of national lockdown. But that would incite public anger and involve privacy invasions—and litigation—on a nightmarish scale.
That, in turn, would exacerbate the economic challenges Mr. Biden would face, since a new administration would arrive in the Oval Office to face a Himalayan federal debt thanks to the Covid-19 bailouts. Mr. Biden would have little choice but to resort to draconian tax policies. Yet, at the same time, he would be expected to execute a dramatic about-face on Trump’s America-first trade policies, starting with a re-engagement with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Linked to that would be reversals on tariff policy with China and, touchiest of all, immigration. Those, too, will surely generate a significant populist backlash, not to mention instability in American financial markets. 
Mr. Biden would probably face his greatest challenges from within his own party rather than from Republicans. He is the mask of “normalcy” on a party which has moved increasingly and impatiently to the left. Once in office, Mr. Biden would be under pressure from his onetime competitors for the nomination— Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and even his vice president, Kamala Harris —to take restrictive steps on gun ownership, “hate speech” and religious freedom, all the while urging a national health plan and the end of fossil fuels. Mr. Biden is clearly sympathetic to some parts of that agenda, but the costs of implementing them all, and at a pace that will satisfy his progressive legions, would be sure to generate conflict. That conflict could easily find a center around Ms. Harris, thus setting up an uneasy tension between the president and vice president.
Whatever progressive pressures Mr. Biden might feel, he would have to cope with the reality of the electoral map. Mr. Biden’s lead rests on his command of the Pacific Coast, the Northeast and two states of the Upper Midwest (Michigan and Wisconsin) that he will have won narrowly after Mr. Trump carried them in 2016. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has dominated 22 central states between the Rockies and the Appalachians, and it is there—in what “coastals” like to call “flyover country”—that a new sense of American strength is stirring. 
The great coastal cities remain vital economic entrepôts. But as Joel Kotkin writes in American Affairs, they have been ebbing population ever since the Great Recession of 2008-09—some 40,000 annually from New York City—and that trend has accelerated since the pandemic. America’s fastest-growing metropolitan areas include Dallas-Fort Worth; Nashville, Tenn.; Indianapolis; and Des Moines, Iowa, but not Seattle or Philadelphia. The fast-growing areas are also the youngest, in terms of birth rates and age demography. 
Economically, the continental core produced some $5 trillion in goods and services in 2016 and created a much more equal spread of wealth than the far coasts. Even software writers live better in San Antonio than in San Francisco. “While overall GDP has grown at a roughly equal rate for the coasts and the western heartland, the two regions have experienced success in different ways,” economist Edward Glaeser writes in City Journal. “When Texas succeeds, its economy provides moderate prosperity to many. When Silicon Valley succeeds, its economy provides extreme prosperity to a few.”
Recognizing that reality was at the heart of Mr. Trump’s winning campaign in 2016; it very nearly delivered the same result in 2020, despite the incessant backbiting of a hostile political class and media and the unprecedented blow of the coronavirus pandemic. It is a reality that has transformed the Republican Party from the overstuffed patricians’ club of the Eisenhower and Reagan decades to what Frank Buckley calls “the Republican Workers Party.” And it is a reality that Mr. Biden and his party will ignore at their peril.

2020/11/06,Return to Normalcy? Not on the Streets of Philadelphia,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/return-to-normalcy-not-on-the-streets-of-philadelphia-11604703716,"Philadelphia
As the sun sets the night after the election, the streets around City Hall feel like a dystopian street fair.
Illuminated by garish purple lights, leftist speakers lead rants and chants from the tricked-out back of an old delivery truck. A marching band’s drum section materializes, and, inexplicably, so does someone in an Elmo costume. Everyone is masked, no one is socially distanced, and everyone I speak to has a bleak outlook on life. The Philadelphia police bicycle by, looking neutered compared with the National Guard, which stands a block away with rifles strapped across their chests. A capitalist sells Black Lives Matter swag. Most downtown shops have hung plywood to deter looters, painted over with reassurances that they’re still open. They look closed. 
It’s a scene for either Tom Wolfe or Tom Waits. Cal Globig, 23, takes it in quietly, then comments in a flat voice: “Everything’s f— up. I feel like I’m waiting for a lot of things to change. I feel like this”—being at a protest—“is doing something. And it feels good to be surrounded by people that are pissed off.”
In Philadelphia and other cities, radical leftists planned protests for Nov. 4 regardless of the election outcome. Wednesday’s demonstrations were peaceful here, but if you hoped a Biden presidency would bring tranquility to urban America’s streets, forget it.
“No matter what goes down on Election Day, we will gather this Wednesday and every Weds until the fall of the regime,” pronounced a flier circulating in several cities. The self-described “rebel alliance” network Crimethinc.com explained that “if Biden wins, there will still be police, prisons, deportations, ecological destruction, capitalism—a Biden victory is not the end of this struggle, it is just the beginning of a new chapter.”
Still, Daryle Lamont Jenkins, executive director of the antifa-allied nonprofit One People’s Project, sees vindication in the election results. He says Mr. Biden is “getting states that Trump won last time that saw unrest in the past six months, so that’s not a rebuke.” He adds that “the fight’s going to go on with some Democrats who don’t seem to get it.” The goal, he stresses, isn’t a return to normalcy: “Normalcy means we go back to being more or less a benign unit out there. Normalcy does not solve our problems. Abnormalcy does, in this respect.” 
Many of the demonstrators I interviewed have little use for the Democratic Party. Microphone in hand, a speaker Wednesday night bemoans how “the Democratic Party enabled Trump” and “enabled his policies the last four years.” She’s particularly outraged that Democrats didn’t fight to block Justice Amy Coney Barrett: “They did not do anything. They could have mobilized the mass movements that we have seen all summer long—the Black Lives Matter movement, the people who have gone on strike, the teachers—and they did none of that. So we have to be very real about the fact that Joe Biden, if he wins this, he won it despite himself. He won this because of these mass movements, not because he’s a good candidate.” The crowd applauds.
From this perspective, Democrats owe a debt for a Biden victory, and those in the streets intend to collect it. Unless the radical left wields the threat of unrest, “I think if push comes to shove, the Democratic Party is going to let Trump and the right wing just roll right over them,” says Lile Harris, 22, who’s out Wednesday night evangelizing for Philadelphia’s Socialist Alternative group.
Among the protesters I interviewed, urgent goals include the abolition of the Electoral College, a $15 minimum wage, the Green New Deal, Medicare for All and expansive curbs on police power and funding. They play hardball, exerting their will through a combination of street action and social-media shaming. This intimidating strategy may not win elections, but it can shape policy—especially if Democrats are as spineless as the radical left believes. 
Protesters project an attitude of harsh cynicism and rebellion. Ms. Globig says she remembers last feeling hopeful about politics in middle school, when Barack Obama was elected and “I was much younger.” What “definitely changed me” was attending Vassar College and having “radical professors” and “a few classes aimed at sort of dissecting how the U.S. works on social and political and economic levels.” Moving to Philadelphia a year and a half ago also shaped her political evolution: “I think Philly has one of the largest and most vibrant socialist and anarchist communities I’ve ever encountered.” 
Ms. Globig admits, “I don’t know how much people taking to the streets will change.” At the same time, “the narrative that the liberals will save you, the police will save you—just admitting that is a façade is refreshing.” She suggests that radical change may require “shaking the foundation” in the way that we’ve seen amid this summer’s unrest. 
“I approve of destruction where it makes a statement and sort of hurts the right people.” Looting looks like a minor offense compared with “police violence and the entire country being stolen from Native people hundreds of years ago.” Ms. Globig describes herself as a moderate: “You could get much further left voices here. I think I’m actually a little bit conservative compared to a lot of Philadelphians.”

2020/11/06,The ACLU’s Betrayal of Athletic Girls,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-aclus-betrayal-of-athletic-girls-11604703511,"I wanted to swim when I entered high school in 1968, but there was no girls’ team at my school—or anywhere in Illinois. The coach told me that if I made certain cutoff times, I would be permitted to train with the boys’ team. But I wasn’t allowed to compete: When the time came for meets, all I could do was sit on the sidelines and cheer for the boys. 
In 1972, with help from the American Civil Liberties Union, my father and I filed a class-action lawsuit in 1972 against the Illinois High School Association on behalf of high-school girls who wanted to compete in school sports. We didn’t prevail in our lawsuit, in part because a federal judge observed that males have certain physical advantages over females, and therefore schools had valid reasons to keep athletic competitions separated by sex. 
Also in 1972, Congress enacted Title IX, a law that prohibits sex discrimination by schools that receive federal money. That led to the creation of many women’s athletic teams and leagues and new opportunities for female athletes.
Since women were allowed their own teams, they no longer sought permission to try out for a spot on men’s and boys’ teams. That issue was moot.
Now it’s arisen again, in reverse. Biological males who identify themselves as transgender are demanding to join women’s and girls’ teams. That discriminates against biological females, thwarting the progress made in the past 50 years.
On July 29, I joined more than 300 female current and former athletes in signing a letter to the National College Athletic Association, urging it not to give in to pressure to boycott the state of Idaho. In March lawmakers in Boise enacted the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act to protect the integrity of women’s athletics. 
Activists urged the NCAA to pull its events, including March Madness basketball games, from the state. The association deferred a decision pending a review of its own transgender policy and the outcome of a federal lawsuit against Idaho. In September a federal judge issued an injunction against the enforcement of Idaho’s law and allowed two female Idaho college athletes to intervene in its defense.
Past gains by female athletes are now being destroyed. Idaho is merely responding to these threats. And the ACLU, which 50 years ago supported my fight for women’s opportunities in athletics, today is on the other side. It led the effort to boycott Idaho and represents the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the state.
Transgender athletes deserve our respect, but that respect must be mutual. Women and girls are being displaced by biologically male athletes, who have clear physical advantages. Again, it is the female athlete who is being denied a spot on the team, the pursuit of a dream, and being told to watch from the sidelines. That’s regression, not progress.

Except one has been teed up for weeks, over Pennsylvania’s extension of its ballot deadline in plain contravention of state law. Federal courts have already slapped down similar efforts by local officials in other states now engaged in pivotal vote-counting. The press, with surveys in hand showing Democrats were more likely than Republicans to vote by mail, dutifully averted its eyes from the problems inherent in mail balloting. Let one report in the Las Vegas Review-Journal suffice: “The Clark County Election Department lowered the factory settings on its signature verification machine.”
From county election board to county election board, there’s no possibility of a uniform and consistent standard for signature verification. This is a giant pitfall, potentially bottomless, in a squeaker election. Mail-in balloting multiplies the ways a legally entitled voter can cast a vote that can’t be counted under law. The country walked right into this mess. Remember the larger phenomenon that all of us are caught up in, including Mr. Trump: 330 million Americans, in their hopes and anxieties, are so closely divided down the middle that it taxes our ability to define and count “legal votes” with precision.
If a Biden victory stands, at least the Trump revisionism can begin. No president has needed it more.
Mourned David Brooks of the New York Times after Election Day: “Our job in the media is to capture reality so that when reality voices itself, like last night, people aren’t surprised. Pretty massive failure.”
The president the press convinced itself was a Russian asset, a white supremacist, a grifter who botched the nation’s coronavirus response, collected nearly seven million more votes than he did in 2016. He received a large number of votes from blacks and Latinos. He created more coattails for his party in losing than Joe Biden did in winning. He received more votes than any candidate in history except Mr. Biden, whose own turnout miracle was certainly more Mr. Trump’s doing than Mr. Biden’s.
What didn’t go wrong in the media’s grasp of the Trump phenomenon? He was the most known and revealed person ever to run for president, and most of what was known was conventionally disqualifying. His nonconformity was his calling card—he wouldn’t have been president otherwise. Somehow the media never really took this on board.

Its other big mistake, always ill-advised, was mind reading. The word “narcissism” got a workout. So did “empathy”—which Mr. Trump supposedly lacked. “Dog whistle” became the media’s magic wand for interpreting his every word to suit the media’s image of him rather than to understand where he was coming from. Possibly the dumbest sentence of the year belonged to Mr. Trump’s estranged niece, a psychologist. In the Washington Post, she wrote that a failure of empathy explained his withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.
It’s a subject for another day but a media penchant for infantile mythmaking is not new—think of the mainstream interpretations that attributed the Iraq war to George W. Bush’s oedipal issues or the machinations of Halliburton.
Mr. Trump described himself to a White House colleague as “a total act.” The act continues with the hail of lawsuits by which he’s preparing for the necessity of conceding the election without conceding defeat (a central no-no of the Trump shtick). His was not much of a confession for a politician but the media is an act too. Take the MSNBC rolling chyron on Friday that said “Biden storms to the lead in Pennsylvania” for a phenomenon of sleep-deprived officials counting mail ballots that had been sitting in boxes since Tuesday. The press has catered all along to Mr. Trump’s act and profited from it even as it deluded itself with lazy dodges about Russian collusion and white supremacy.
And yet, theatrics aside, Mr. Trump’s presidential decisions were interesting and entirely non-disastrous, which isn’t something every president can say. Look closely and even his coronavirus actions and rhetoric mostly followed the same convoluted path of Andrew Cuomo and other global leaders. Mr. Trump made one gutsy, unpolitician-like decision at the end—to live and die on the economic recovery being more important to voters than the virus. One more surprise: Exit polls show a majority of voters agreed with him and not a monolithic press on this point.
Since a 1967 Murray Kempton article about Eisenhower, it’s been routine, after the fact, to discover a president was not the simple dunce whose every act could be characterized by a few stylized traits the media assigned to him for its own convenience. The mystery of some of Mr. Trump’s choices may always elude us, at least until he dictates his memoirs. Of course, none of us really control our destiny. In the cold light of history, the Russia hoax, concocted by his enemies, may be the factor that determined the path of the Trump presidency more than any other.

2020/11/06,Can We Trust the Process in Philadelphia?,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-we-trust-the-process-in-philadelphia-11604685839,"“Bad things happen in Philadelphia,” said President Donald Trump at the first presidential debate in September. Many residents of the city reacted angrily to his comment on its conduct of elections, while a few chose to emblazon the remark on T-shirts as a humorous declaration of civic toughness. Outside the City of Brotherly Love, some Americans are wondering if bad things are happening there right now.
This doesn’t mean people are buying Mr. Trump’s Thursday claim that election officials are trying to commit fraud. Huge vote totals in Philadelphia have helped push former Vice President Joe Biden to a statewide lead in Pennsylvania. 
But Mr. Trump seems to have a case when he criticizes the transparency of the vote-counting process. On Friday morning the Trump campaign’s Corey Lewandowski told your humble correspondent’s co-author Maria Bartiromo that Philadelphia election officials still weren’t complying with a court order to allow observers to position themselves close to ballot counters.
On Thursday night Mr. Trump said:
Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania does not agree with that conclusion. “The president’s speech last night was very disturbing to me because he made very, very serious allegations without evidence,” Mr. Toomey said in an appearance on the television program “CBS This Morning.”
Yet Mr. Toomey also noted problems with the process and acknowledged the sad history of voting abuses in Philadelphia. Sen. Toomey also echoed the points he made in a Thursday statement which addressed both a strange legal ruling which purports to rewrite a statewide ballot deadline, as well as issues specific to Philadelphia:
Hear, hear. More transparency would be especially beneficial given Philadelphia’s history. After Mr. Trump’s September debate comment, Chris Brennan and Sean Collins Walsh recounted some of the lowlights in the Philadelphia Inquirer:
The guilty judge is named Domenick DeMuro. CNN’s Ellie Kaufman noted in July that the government has also charged the person alleged to have bribed him:
At the time of the indictment the Inquirer’s Jeremy Roebuck noted the activity that long ago landed the former lawmaker in prison:
The intricacies are not exactly transparent. Mr. Roebuck added:
The Inquirer account added more background on Philadelphia politics:
Here’s hoping for transparency in Philadelphia and everywhere else people are still counting ballots.

Trump’s Parting Gift?
Whoever wins the presidential election, Americans may wish to take a moment to thank our current President for setting the table for a robust economic rebound. Mr. Trump enacted pro-growth reductions in tax and regulatory burdens, and has lately been wisely resisting a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus plan from Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.).

2020/11/07,Biden’s Mandate for Moderation,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-mandate-for-moderation-11604772177,"I want to congratulate President-elect Biden on his victory. Everyone, regardless of political affiliation, should want him to succeed because we need our country to succeed.
Precisely because I want him and America to succeed, I’d like to offer Mr. Biden some unsolicited advice. If he is going to heal and unify the nation, he must start by recognizing that this goal is in conflict with the Democratic Party’s lurch leftward. Pushing a far-left agenda would bitterly divide the country. It may be what the loudest voices in Mr. Biden’s party are demanding, but he wasn’t elected to divide and disrupt. He won the election because America is fed up with bitter partisanship, divisiveness and dysfunction.
Look at the results down the ballot. Despite suffering the first loss for an incumbent president since 1992, Republicans added a governorship in Montana, appear to have held the Senate majority, and even gained seats in the House. Americans wouldn’t vote for divided government if they wanted radical change. 
During the campaign, Mr. Biden deflected questions about his party’s embrace of massive tax hikes, the Green New Deal and other economic policies that would crush the economic recovery, instead focusing on the president’s record and character. In the first debate, when confronted with these extreme policies widely embraced by his fellow Democrats, Mr. Biden stated: “I am the Democratic Party.” Now is the time for him to prove it.
Placating the far-left base of the party may have been an effective campaign strategy, but it is not a viable approach to governing. Joe Biden now must choose whether he wants to be a unifier or a progressive activist. 
Some on the far left want him to use his presidency for revenge and control rather than to bring Americans together. They have proposed abolishing the Senate’s legislative filibuster to eliminate the need for consensus and deliberation and to pack the Supreme Court. Notably, in the final days of the campaign, Mr. Biden refused to rule out these tactics, which would undermine Americans’ confidence in their institutions and disrupt constitutional order. Voters had to elect a GOP Senate majority to take such extreme proposals off the table. 
Many in the Democratic Party may feel that they were treated unfairly when Republicans controlled the White House. I’ve spoken out when I felt my members of my party were doing more to inflame toxic politics than to solve real problems. And I certainly know from experience that it’s not easy to say no to your base or to stand up to the loudest and angriest voices. 
Americans turned out in record numbers to vote against the opposing candidate, not for their own. If there ever was a time for us to focus on tuning out the extremes and coming together as one country, it’s now. 
We have a choice. We can either continue to perpetuate toxic politics, or we can work together to build a better future. We can either try to score points on social media, or we can come together to solve problems and make life better for all Americans. We can either move forward together, or we can continue to slide backward, divided. Now is the time to govern.
The overwhelming majority of Americans are completely fed up with politics as usual and want us to move forward together. What they desperately want is for elected officials to work on bipartisan, common-sense solutions to the serious problems we face.
Americans consistently rank the divisiveness and dysfunction in Washington as the most important problem facing our country. They don’t want to grant more power to either party in Washington. They want Washington to get its act together. This exhausted majority of Americans are not the voices we hear on social media, cable news or talk radio. But they have placed their trust in Mr. Biden. My sincere hope is that he won’t let them down.
Even in my very blue state of Maryland—which Mr. Biden won by nearly 30 points—the far-left agenda is widely unpopular. My 2018 opponent ran on the Green New Deal, massive tax hikes and other far-left priorities. Marylanders soundly rejected these policies because they much preferred bipartisanship and common-sense solutions.
This dilemma isn’t new for President-elect Biden. In 2008, millions of Americans were inspired by Barack Obama’s vision of America as “not a collection of red states or blue states” but the United States. His election brought hope that a new era of bipartisanship and unity was possible. President Obama chose to give priority to progressive policy changes rather than the original promise of his candidacy. Eight years later, even he recognized “that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,” acknowledging in his last State of the Union address that this was one of the “regrets of my presidency.”
Now, after another divisive four years and an even more tumultuous campaign, I respectfully urge Joe Biden to not lead us down the same course. The consequences of four more years of divisiveness and dysfunction in Washington would be devastating. I stand ready and willing to work together with the president-elect for the greater good of our nation and all our citizens. If he chooses unity over division and common-sense solutions over partisan dogma, then he will find a partner here in Maryland. More important, it would earn him the gratitude and support of the American people.
Mr. Hogan, a Republican, is governor of Maryland.

2020/11/07,"If He Loses, Trump Will Concede Gracefully",Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-he-loses-trump-will-concede-gracefully-11604772109,"I’ve been asked the same question at least a hundred times in the past week: If the president loses, will he participate in a peaceful transition of power? 
The question probably says as much about those asking it as the answer does about President Trump. Most of the inquirers are the same people who still don’t understand why nearly half the country voted for Mr. Trump. They still wonder if he somehow cheated his way into office. They still think he should’ve been impeached, believe the polls, and consider the Washington Post, New York Times and CNN reliable sources.
But, I am happy to answer: Yes.
I don’t pretend, simply because I served as White House chief of staff for 15 months, to know the president more deeply than anyone. But I’m familiar with his manner and style and know a little about how he thinks.
Early in my term as chief, we were mired in the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. The administration was pilloried in the press nightly, and while that was nothing new, we were eager to fight back. The team devised several ideas about how to reclaim the momentum.
A few that we floated to Mr. Trump would’ve had him publicly confront Speaker Nancy Pelosi about her decision to leave town instead of continue discussions. He was livid: “Dammit, Mick, I am the president of the United States. I am not going to pull off that kind of petty crap.”
His response surprised me. We’d tailored several of our options to Trump the Showman. What we got instead was Trump the President.
Mr. Trump instead addressed the nation from the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. It was the only time he did so during my tenure (and one of only a few times in his). It was a sober message on a serious topic at a tense time. It was delivered from a location that conveys gravitas in a way few others can. There’s no denying it was appropriate for the moment.
The president knew the time for showmanship and the time for serious discussion. And no occasion is more fit for seriousness than a national transition of power at the highest levels. 
The president will fight like a gladiator until the election is conclusively determined, and Joe Biden would do the same—not only because it’s their nature, but also because there is so much at stake. More than 150 million Americans registered their preference for the outcome of the election, and all of them are counting on “their” man to do everything he legally can to prevail. Neither candidate is going to throw his hands up before the process is complete and say “Oh, well, I tried.” 
Nor should they. Voters need this election to be fully litigated. Whoever occupies the presidency cannot have rumors floating around for the next four years about dead people voting or ballot dumps in the middle of the night. The U.S. needs to know that the winner is actually the winner.
And once Americans know that, I have every expectation that Mr. Trump will be, act and speak like a great president should—win or lose.
Mr. Mulvaney served as a U.S. representative from South Carolina (2011-17), director of the Office of Management and Budget (2017-20) and acting White House chief of staff (2018-20).

2020/11/08,What Happened to the Protests?,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-happened-to-the-protests-11604875929,"Can we take down the plywood over the windows now? With Joe Biden on his way to the White House, can we show our goods again in the storefront, confident that “largely peaceful” protesters won’t loot the place or burn it down?
We thought we’d ask on behalf of America’s urban shopkeepers, from Beverly Hills to Manhattan, who had boarded up their windows in anticipation of post-election violence. In the event, Mr. Biden has won the election pending recounts and, what do you know, there was little or no violence. Instead the streets were filled Saturday with partisans celebrating the democratic result they wanted.
The Trump supporters stayed home. No doubt they are disappointed, perhaps even angry. But perhaps they are also accepting the results as unfortunate though the price of living in a democratic republic. Sometimes your candidate loses.
Would it have been the same if Donald Trump had won? You know the answer. The protests would have been ugly, perhaps worse even than earlier this year. And the media and many Democratic politicians would have cheered them on, or at least not objected as they also failed to object this summer. They would have blamed the disorder on Mr. Trump.
All of this reveals the extent to which this year’s riots were part of a political strategy. They may have started as a protest against the death of George Floyd and police abuses against black men. But as the riots rolled on, the goal for many protesters and their cheerleaders was to show that the country had become ungovernable under Mr. Trump. 
The point was to tell Americans that ending the unrest required a change in government. You might even call it a violent prelude to a time to heal.

2020/11/08,The Senate in the Balance,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-senate-in-the-balance-11604873708,"‘Now we take Georgia, then we change the world. Now we take Georgia, then we change America.” So declared an ebullient Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader, on Saturday as he addressed supporters, and voters in Georgia should pay attention. The Peach State holds two Senate runoff races on Jan. 5, and how they turn out will determine whether Washington steers toward the center or sharply to the left.
If incumbents in North Carolina and Alaska hold their current leads, Republicans will have 50 Senate seats in the next Congress. But they need 51 for a majority to organize the body because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will preside over the Senate. She would cast the deciding vote in a 50-50 Senate.
What difference would a single vote make? Republicans would lose their committee chairmanships and thus the power to serve as a check on the Biden Administration. Joe Biden deserves the Cabinet he wants in most cases, but a GOP Senate could deter appointments like Elizabeth Warren at Treasury. Oversight Chairman Ron Johnson’s probe of FBI and other abuses would cease. 
Or consider the Democrats poised to run key committees if they organize the Senate. Bernie Sanders would run Budget, which means a squeeze on the Pentagon. Sherrod Brown of Ohio would run Banking, and Ms. Warren would run the financial institutions subcommittee. Have fun, bankers.
Oregon’s Ron Wyden would run Finance. He supports the $4 trillion Biden tax increase plus he wants to tax even unrealized capital gains as ordinary income. That means taxing the appreciation in the value of assets even if they aren’t sold during the year. He isn’t kidding.
Some business folks think nothing like this could happen in a 50-50 Senate. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin would supposedly save the day, or Joe Biden would intervene. Don’t count on it. Mr. Manchin is a reliable Democratic vote on every big issue when it really matters, and Mr. Biden will be under pressure from progressives (and Ms. Harris) to achieve their goals.
Even without breaking the 60-vote legislative filibuster rule, Democrats could pass a budget under reconciliation rules with 50 votes plus the Vice President to make 51. This can include spending and tax measures. Most of the Biden plan would pass because Democrats want the revenue to spend.
A 50-seat Democratic majority led by Mr. Schumer might also be willing to break the filibuster. The New Yorker fears a primary challenge in 2022 from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has a national following and could raise tens of millions of dollars if Mr. Schumer disappoints progressives. A Senate platform would vault AOC into the mix for a presidential run in 2024.
All of this should be front-and-center for voters in the Georgia runoffs. The suburban Atlanta Republicans and independents who voted for Mr. Biden to oust Donald Trump are likely to support a GOP Senate as a check on Mr. Biden’s left wing if they know the stakes.
Mr. Trump and his allies should also keep the Georgia runoffs in mind as they fight legal battles over the presidential race. A bitter-end attempt to urge state legislators to override state ballot counts in awarding Electoral College votes could backfire with voters who otherwise would vote for divided government. Mr. Trump’s future influence will diminish if he costs Republicans the Senate majority as he leaves the White House. The Georgia stakes couldn’t be higher.

2020/11/08,Joe Biden’s ‘Time to Heal’,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-bidens-time-to-heal-11604873786,"Joe Biden sent an encouraging message Saturday night in declaring “a time to heal” as he claimed victory in the race for the White House. Toppling an incumbent President is no small achievement, and congratulations are in order assuming his votes in the Electoral College hold.
“Let’s give each other a chance” and “put away the harsh rhetoric,” Mr. Biden said. “Stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They’re Americans.” After a campaign in which he called the incumbent a racist and blamed him for every Covid-19 death, we’ll give the former Vice President the benefit of the doubt that he means what he says now. And hold him to it. 
Mr. Trump hasn’t conceded and claims to have won the election if only legal votes are counted. But he’ll have to overturn Mr. Biden’s leads in some combination of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, and that’s a very long shot. The deadlines for vote counting and official validation are fixed in law and inexorable. Mr. Trump isn’t obliged to concede or congratulate his opponent if he loses, though it would be better for the country and his own legacy if he did.
So much, by the way, for Mr. Trump’s “authoritarian” takeover. His opponents have spent four years warning that he is a would-be Hitler who would stage an American Reichstag fire (Yale professor Timothy Snyder) or slowly extinguish political freedom (pick a progressive pundit). The 25th Amendment was invoked as a way to remove Mr. Trump from office. 
These elites lost faith in American democracy and its institutions when they panicked after Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016. The left and some conservatives spent four years refusing to accept his election as legitimate, and Democrats deployed the FBI in 2016 to subvert his candidacy and then undermine his ability to govern. It was the dirtiest trick in American presidential history. These elites only trust democracy when they dominate it.
The American public has behaved more rationally and exhibited its will through the ballot box. The largest voter turnout in decades shows their democratic engagement. Voters gave Democrats the House in 2018 to check Mr. Trump, and now the party has captured the White House. This year Democrats might have won the Senate, and not lost seats in the House, if they hadn’t frightened the country with their threats to pack the Supreme Court and break the legislative filibuster.
Democrats didn’t win this election so much as Mr. Trump lost it. The President has many achievements, not least his tax reform and deregulation that gave the long but weak Obama economic expansion a second wind. Yet Mr. Trump always made himself, rather than his ideas, the center of all political attention. Democrats were happy to oblige and used his persona and chaotic governance against him. 
No one outworks Mr. Trump as a campaigner. And his admirable focus on middle-class Americans who were long ignored and disdained by coastal elites explains the passion of his supporters. 
But he ran for re-election in scattershot fashion, with no consistent message. He never took apart Mr. Biden’s policies, and his performance in the first debate reminded many why they disliked him. His inconsistent, sometimes dismissive handling of Covid-19 also cost him. 
Republicans elevated Mr. Trump as an outsider who would disrupt the Washington political class, and in many ways he did. But in the end he lacked the political skill to persuade a majority that his disruption was worth the cost of political divisions and the risks of a second term. Character does count in a President.
Mr. Biden will enter the White House after one of the most unusual elections in history. He didn’t change his party as most successful candidates do. Democrats instead elevated Mr. Biden as their last-chance moderate to defeat Bernie Sanders in the primaries and then run a character campaign against Mr. Trump. It proved a smart bet. Rep. James Clyburn, who rallied the moderate black vote behind Mr. Biden in South Carolina, saved the party from a left-wing nominee who would have lost.
Credit Mr. Biden for running a disciplined campaign focused on being the anti-Trump who would crush Covid and unify the country. There’s no reason from the campaign to think he will do any better than Mr. Trump on Covid, except sound more serious. But his message fit the mood of a worried public tired of constant political warfare. His strategy of barely venturing in public, and barely answering questions, limited his potential for mistakes. And the media, united in trying to defeat the President they loathe, gave Mr. Biden a pass.
Mr. Biden’s narrow campaign message—Covid, character and pre-existing conditions on health care—leaves him with a governing dilemma. He has a mandate to end the pandemic and heal partisan divisions. But with the Democratic defeats down ballot, he lacks a mandate for the policies he promised his party’s left. Mr. Trump had more coattails than he did.
In the fine print of the Sanders-Biden unity document, you will find the most radical progressive agenda in decades. But few in the media other than these columns examined it in any depth. Mr. Biden rarely mentioned it. The Americans who voted for him mainly to defeat Mr. Trump do not want a radical economic, political or cultural agenda.
Mr. Biden won’t say this publicly, but he will be fortunate if Republicans retain control of the Senate with the two Georgia runoffs in January. He will need the leverage of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to steer a middle course against House Democrats and the Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing in the Senate. 
Our sense is that, left to his own instincts, Mr. Biden is not an ideologue like Barack Obama. He is a pragmatic man of the center-left who can work across the aisle. But he will soon be 78 years old, and his vigor is clearly on the wane. He will have to battle younger progressives, inside and outside his Administration, who will be frustrated by the divided government Americans voted for and will want him to cede power sooner rather than later to Kamala Harris. 
Mr. Biden’s peril is that he will have accomplished his main campaign mission on the day he takes the oath of office: Ousting Donald Trump. He is setting the right tone as he begins to form a government. But the biggest obstacle to restoring more political calm and comity won’t come from the post-Trump Republicans. It will come from his own party’s left.

2020/11/08,The States Are Laboratories for Covid Control,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-states-are-laboratories-for-covid-control-11604867730,"The U.S. is poised to get a new president amid a worsening crisis: The country is logging more than 100,000 new Covid cases a day, and this probably only represents one-fifth of total infections. Hospitalizations and deaths are rising, including in nursing homes and long-term-care facilities, which recorded at least 19,000 infections this week and about 1,800 deaths. But President-elect Joe Biden can look to some states as a model for handling the pandemic.
It will be essential during the transition to take steps to preserve life and liberty. Covid-19 is highly contagious, and spread was inevitable. But it didn’t need to be this bad in America. The country has been arguing over a straw man that sets up lockdowns as the only means to epidemic control. But broad stay-at-home orders and business closures aren’t necessary if policy makers take steps now to slow spread and preserve health-care capacity.
In Massachusetts, where I am part of an advisory group to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, testing has been at the center of the state’s efforts to help control outbreaks. Coronavirus testing went from 3,000 a day in March to about 100,000 a day this fall. On a per capita basis, the state’s testing capacity is the best in the nation most days. Massachusetts has many free testing sites, and people are encouraged to use them. The governor has championed a universal message about the value of masks, which have been widely adopted. Bars and nightclubs have stayed closed.
My home state of Connecticut was hit hard during the first wave of the epidemic in the spring, and many people died, especially in nursing homes. Like other states in the region, Connecticut closed businesses and had people staying home. But Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont took a more measured approach to maximize effectiveness and reduce economic costs.
Businesses such as construction and manufacturing were allowed to continue. And like Massachusetts, Connecticut rolled out an enormous amount of testing. Against the backdrop of rising infection, the governor introduced targeted mitigation measures this week, like asking restaurants to close by 9:30 p.m., and suspending some high-school sports but preserving in-class instruction, which has been available since the start of the school year. More than half of all students have been in school this fall.
 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, as chairman of the National Governors Association, helped create an interstate testing compact that pooled purchasing power across states and helped ensure supplies were apportioned equitably. Mr. Hogan, whom I also advised, worked closely with leaders in low-income areas, where residents faced a disproportionate burden from the pandemic. He was also the first governor to send “strike teams” into nursing homes, consisting of National Guard resources, public-health officials, and providers from local hospital systems. The goal of these efforts was to focus state resources into the communities most at risk from infection. Maryland’s strike teams became a model for other states.
Mr. Biden will be taking over at one of the most difficult moments of the epidemic, when infection may be cresting. Things will improve in 2021, as the acute wave subsides and as vaccines and therapeutics hopefully become more widely available.
The first order of business for Mr. Biden should be a comprehensive program to get public schools open for in-person learning before the spring semester. This is achievable with proper protective equipment for teachers, resources for improving air systems, and measures to improve distancing. Another priority should be getting states help in rolling out vaccines, therapeutics and testing, particularly to underserved populations. The good news for Mr. Biden is that he can adopt some of the best practices learned in the states.

2020/11/08,Voters (Mostly) Reject Tax Hikes,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/voters-mostly-reject-tax-hikes-11604867685,"Taxation was on the ballot last week, and not only in the presidential race. Voters in California and Illinois rejected ballot measures that would have raised their taxes, while those in Arkansas and Arizona approved tax hikes. Coloradans voted for a tax cut.
In fiscally strapped Illinois, one of nine states with a flat income tax, Gov. J.B. Pritzker led a campaign for a constitutional amendment to allow a graduated or progressive tax. Mr. Pritzker promised it would hit only the rich and threatened voters with budget cuts and other broad-based tax increases. Illinoisans called his bluff, voting 55% to 45% against the tax hike. 
In Colorado, all the left’s spending interests and structures tried and failed to get enough signatures for a constitutional ballot measure to allow a progressive income tax. But a countervailing effort led by Jon Caldara of the Independence Institute did get enough signatures. This was a simple reduction in the state income tax, from 4.63% to 4.55%. It passed, 57% to 43%. 
Colorado voters also passed Proposition 117 to close a loophole in the state’s Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights. That 1992 amendment to the state constitution, known as Tabor, limits the growth of government by tying it to inflation and population growth and requires the people to vote on any state or local tax increase. Over time, clever politicians found the courts would let them relabel tax hikes as “fees” not requiring voter approval. Coloradans voted 52.3% to 47.7% to close this loophole. Taxes by any other name will require a vote of the people.
California produced the original tax revolts of the 1970s and ’80s, and this year faint echoes could be heard of a time when ordinary Californians weren’t so complacent about Sacramento’s insatiable appetite for revenue. Golden State voters opted to protect Proposition 13, the 1978 amendment to the California constitution that limits annual increases on property-tax rates. Rates on residential and commercial property are capped at 1% of assessed value, and assessments can increase by no more than 2% annually. Democratic lawmakers, who hold supermajorities in both houses of the state Legislature, sought to raise $12 billion by abolishing those protections for commercial properties while maintaining them on residences. Homeowners realized that this was merely Act I of a two-act play and their protection against ever higher property taxes would be up next. California rejected this tax hike, 52% to 48%.
Business taxes were also on the ballot in Alaska, where the state voted down a tax hike on the oil industry, 56% to 44%. A similar attempt to bleed Alaska’s energy producers failed in 2014. The industry already provides gushers of revenue for the state, and Alaskans apparently decided it wasn’t in their interest to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. 
Cheerleaders for big government did win two tax hikes with the support of voters. In Arkansas, Republican Gov. Asa Hutchison used an old playbook. A sales-tax increase that took effect in 2013 on the promise that it would be temporary was set to end in 2023. He placed Issue 1 on the ballot to make it permanent, arguing that this wasn’t really a tax hike because it was already there. Voters approved the measure, 55% to 44%. Arkansas now has the highest state sales tax in the region.
Stand for Children, a Portland, Ore.-based foundation, funded an initiative drive (for the second time) in Arizona to impose a 3.5% income-tax surcharge on high earners, with the money earmarked for education. The initiative, backed heavily by the teachers union, passed narrowly. In 2018 the state Supreme Court struck down a previous version of the measure because of its misleading ballot text. The court noted it “imposes tax increases on most Arizona taxpayers rather than only the state’s wealthiest taxpayers.” Expect another lawsuit soon challenging the measure on state constitutional grounds.
 Sherlock Holmes would remind us to look for the dog that didn’t bark in 2020. For the first time since 2014, no state asked voters to consider a carbon tax. All such proposals have failed. Advocates for raising energy prices through taxation have decided that this isn’t a question that should be left to voters. They don’t always do as they’re told.

2020/11/08,Libertarians Spoil the Election,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/libertarians-spoil-the-election-11604867668,"Did the Libertarian Party throw the election to Joe Biden ? Maybe. At this writing nominee Jo Jorgensen’s vote total exceeds Mr. Biden’s margin over President Trump in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, enough to change the outcome.
In 2000 the Green Party was accused of ruining things for the Democrats. Did Ralph Nader throw the election from Al Gore to George W. Bush ? The cognoscenti are still divided, but the 2020 parallels are strong. Probably most Green voters would have gone Democratic if forced into a binary choice. Similarly, on the Libertarian-O-Meter, Mr. Trump scores much higher than Mr. Biden. 
Yes, the Donald is a protectionist, and free trade is the preferred policy of those who favor economic and personal liberty. But when it comes to lowering taxes and easing regulations on business, the party of the elephant is far more closely aligned to the libertarian philosophy than that of the donkey. Mr. Trump has appointed conservatives to the Supreme Court, not libertarians like Randy Barnett, Clint Bolick, Jacob Huebert, Gregory Rome or Brandon Thibodeaux. But supporters of the freedom philosophy prefer judges who adhere to the U.S. Constitution over those who make things up as they go along.
In contrast, Mr. Biden is a puppet in the marionette hands of out-and-out socialists like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Yes, there are some issues on which libertarians are closer to Democrats, such as Oregon’s decriminalization of heroin and cocaine. But these are few and far between.
The national Libertarian Party started in 1971, several state parties earlier. In 1969 I had the honor to run for the New York Assembly. My motto was “Disassemble the Assembly.” I didn’t win; I’m not sure my vote total reached triple digits. But I’ve been a staunch member of the party ever since.
In 2016 physician Donald Miller, historian Ralph Raico and I started a group called Libertarians for Trump. Our advice to libertarian voters was: If you live in Massachusetts or California, strong blue states, vote for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee. The Republicans will lose big there, and your vote for the porcupine won’t help the donkey beat the elephant. Likewise in Louisiana or Alabama, where Mr. Trump was sure to win. But if you live in a purple state, don’t vote Libertarian. It is crucial that Donald beat Hillary!
I kick myself for not reinstituting this effort in 2019. My thought was that Gary Johnson, a former governor, was well-known and might manage 5% of the vote. He actually registered 3.27%, still more than three times the previous record of 1.06%, set by Ed Clark in 1980. I figured Ms. Jorgenson for 0.25%. She now looks on track to exceed Mr. Clark’s percentage slightly—and hand the presidency to Mr. Biden. 
Pardon me while I beat my head against the wall. How could libertarians in purple states be so stupid?

2020/11/08,Venezuela’s Human-Capital Flight,The Americas,https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-human-capital-flight-11604867623,"In an animated video clip posted to Twitter on Nov. 1, Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate Kamala Harris argued that America needs to strive not for equal treatment of individuals but for equity. “Equitable treatment,” she explained, “means we all end up at the same place.”
Efforts to guarantee outcomes are at odds with what it means to live in a free society where equality under the law is the guiding principle. So either Ms. Harris was blowing smoke or she wants to change America into a place where liberty takes a back seat to central planning. The latter is called socialism, a system that is not particularly kind to the poor. 

 Hugo Chávez also promised to make everyone in his country equally well-off. The concept sold in a nation that believed it was infinitely rich because it was swimming in oil. Intellectuals reasoned that he ought to stick it to the haves. When he did, they packed their bags and left.
Of the more than four million Venezuelans who are estimated to have fled their country since 2015, many are unskilled workers who have been forced into menial labor or lives as mendicants in foreign countries. Images of their march into exile have provoked compassion and grief across the globe. 
Yet it is the flight of the knowledge worker that has done the most harm to the nation. As one Venezuelan economist told me recently, “you can be sure that the country’s most skilled professionals were among the first to leave and valued tradesmen were not far behind.” 
The Bolivarian revolution’s earliest large-scale assault on know-how came during a lockout at the monopoly oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PdVSA) in December 2002. Union leaders and the largest association of private enterprises called for the labor action in response to Chávez’s antidemocratic tactics. By February 2003 the effort had fizzled out. But the regime used it to purge at least 18,000 PdVSA and related-company employees, gutting the industry of most of its experienced personnel. By replacing fired workers with political loyalists, Chávez believed he was protecting his golden goose. Some of the most sophisticated PdVSA minds saw the future and fled. 
In 2009 the regime expropriated Venezuelan companies that served the oil industry in the Lake Maracaibo area and in the eastern part of the country. It was one of many politically motivated mistakes that would lead to the end of investment flows. But as long as oil prices were high, the costs of such recklessness was hidden. 
The party ended when prices tanked in 2014, government revenues dropped precipitously, and central bank money-printing led to a mega-devaluation of the bolivar. When PdVSA salaries couldn’t keep up with inflation, another wave of oil engineers—this time led by a younger generation—went abroad to work. In the years that followed, more oil technicians threw in the towel on life in Venezuela.
This vicious circle of declining revenue and human-capital flight has brought the once-mighty Venezuelan petroleum powerhouse to a standstill. Drilling operations and refineries no longer function properly, making the country especially vulnerable to U.S. sanctions. 
There has been a loss of competency in a host of other industries as well. Gone is the presumption that one can turn on the tap for running water. This is reality in many poor countries, and people adapt. But for wealthy Venezuela to fall into such an abyss is mind-boggling. 
From 1992 to 1999, José María de Viana was president of the state-owned water company, Hidrocapital, serving metropolitan Caracas. In an October interview with the Venezuelan news site TalCual, he spoke about the pain that this crisis is causing the poorest Venezuelans and “patients who are confined in hospitals where, in most of them, there is no water.”
“It was a long process,” TalCual wrote, paraphrasing Mr. de Viana, “that began with the professional decline of the [water] companies” that, until 1999, “had the skills to maintain the delicate economic-financial balance that made it possible to cover costs and meet the needs of the population in a timely manner.” The nation’s electrical grid has similarly deteriorated as Venezuelans with the proficiency to maintain the system have left for greener pastures outside the country. Power failures are now routine.
The prospects for reversing Venezuela’s skills gap aren’t good. With incomes of less than $3 a month, many teachers have been pushed out of the profession by the need to survive. Last month the president of the association of professors at the Simón Bolívar University summed up the catastrophe this way: “A country without its children and young people training, learning, as Venezuela is in these gloomy moments, is condemned to continue to being dragged down as a nation and to be more violently devastated.”
It seems like a recipe for all to end up in the same place—to borrow a phrase from Ms. Harris—but not in a good place.

2020/11/08,Mideast Peace Means Open Markets,Inside View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/mideast-peace-means-open-markets-11604867508,"“Once the Sand Curtain starts coming down, there’s no stopping it.” This from my friend Jon Medved, CEO of the Israeli venture-capital firm OurCrowd. He likens the Aug. 13 announcement of the Abraham Accords peace agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel to the Berlin Wall falling and the end of the Iron Curtain. Within a few weeks, Mr. Medved had hired (via Zoom) a senior Emirati deal maker as his man on the ground and announced a $100 million deal with the Al Naboodah merchant family.
For centuries, the route between the two regions was a land bridge for commerce—think of caravans trading goods between the East and West. But that route had been undertrafficked since the U.A.E. was founded in 1971. The hostility and lack of formal relations between the states made commerce near impossible. Plus, the lack of direct flights means it takes about 20 hours to get from Israel to Dubai—heading west to lay over in Zurich or Frankfurt and then coming all the way back east. Come January, there are plans for more than 100 nonstop flights a week, which will take only three hours.

The accords make sense. The U.A.E. and Israel have similar populations of about nine million to 10 million and a roughly equal gross domestic product. The knee-jerk reaction to this deal, and I’m certainly guilty of this, is to think it’s merely a trade of oil for ideas. But there’s much more to it. The U.A.E. is a country of entrepreneurs: They get 20 million tourists a year flocking to hotels and malls and even indoor skiing. Uber recently bought Careem, an internationally operating Emirati ride-sharing company.
I asked Mr. Medved what folks in the U.A.E. want. “Of course they’re interested in cybersecurity, logistics and fintech. But they’re also interested in smart cities and transportation. Remember, they invested in Elon Musk’s Hyperloop. Add alternate energy and even food security—we get asked a lot about agtech—as well as technology for education and health care.” This is a sign of a region modernizing. The U.A.E. even announced on Saturday that it would loosen its religious restrictions on personal freedom.
A U.A.E. webinar named Emirates Angels got government approval within 48 hours. That a webinar needed government approval means there is still some work to do. But Mr. Medved says U.A.E. merchants want to add value and “see eye to eye” with overseas investment partners, instead of merely being a source of money.
A few years ago, I spoke at OurCrowd’s Global Investor Summit, which gets 20,000 registrations and even a few dozen from the Arab world who attend under the radar. While there, I met with many entrepreneurs. When they described their companies’ technology, I naively asked about their domestic market share. One CEO laughed: “Market share? There’s no market here.” Stupid me, the country has about the same population as New Jersey. Israeli tech companies all set up sales offices in New York or Palo Alto, London or Frankfurt. Mr. Medved tells me half of Israeli exports are technology.
But the Middle East is a huge untapped market. Countries within the Arab League have a total population approaching 500 million. The deals being done aren’t only U.A.E. money headed to Israel chasing hot startups. They are about opening the Middle East as a market for Israeli entrepreneurs.
I think that’s what gets the U.A.E. so excited about this deal. The U.S. and even Europe are saturated with technology. So are Japan and South Korea. China and to some extent India are closed markets. The giant flashing dollar sign is in modernizing the Islamic frontier. This is a trillion-dollar opportunity.
As far as big-picture geopolitics, the impact will be enormous. Mr. Medved says, “This wouldn’t have happened without Saudi buy-in.” Plus, Israel has been shut out of selling to the greater Islamic world, like Indonesia, Pakistan and Kazakhstan—Borat too. I suspect future U.S. administrations will want to see the U.A.E. gain control of many ports around the world, as a replacement for China’s Belt and Road initiative. That would require lots of logistics and cloud-computing expertise that Israel can bring to the party.
Mr. Medved isn’t the only one hunting down deals. “We could have had an Israeli venture capitalist association conference in Dubai last week, there were so many of us there.” Right now Israel has 50 unicorns, startups valued at more than $1 billion. Medved told me he’s heard that U.A.E. investors complain it takes 20 hours to get to Silicon Valley, and they can’t wait for three-hour flights to Israel. With elections and pandemics and protests going on around the world these days, very few people have really drilled down to study the impact of the recent peace deals. Don’t underestimate the falling of the Sand Curtain. Open markets and free trade benefit all involved.

2020/11/08,Ranked-Choice Voting Is Far From Optimal,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/ranked-choice-voting-is-far-from-optimal-11604865605,"Regarding your editorial “Ranked-Choice Voting Is Second Best” (Nov. 3): Those who push ranked-choice voting (RCV) make over-the-top claims for it, as we have seen in Massachusetts recently. The ads claim RCV will lead to consensus candidates and remove the impact of spoiler candidates. Not so fast. Stop and ask yourself: Why is RCV being pushed by a group that advocates changes to election laws to help elect liberal candidates? Clearly, they see an advantage beyond the first-mover advantage. 
RCV is really a get-out-the-vote strategy. The New York Times reported that a progressive candidate ran in this year’s Maine Senate race to help throw the race into an RCV decision: “Lisa Savage, a progressive running as an independent in the race, has urged her supporters to list [Sara] Gideon second. . . . Savage emphasized that she was not looking to undercut Gideon in her bid to unseat [Sen. Susan] Collins, but instead to help attract otherwise reluctant, young and first-time voters who were discomfited by the bitter campaign and wary that Ms. Gideon was not liberal enough.” 
Before we change to this system, shouldn’t we ask if we want a dozen (or more) fringe candidates on the ballot who run not to win or to advance a cause but rather to manipulate an election system whose outcome few can understand and fewer can explain? Look at the official election results for the San Francisco mayor’s race in 2011 which had 16 candidates and went 12 rounds. Transparency isn’t a feature of RCV, and it will lead to more polarization, not consensus, as the parties figure out how to win RCV elections.

One of the problems with ranked-choice voting is that not all votes cast are treated equally. In a four-person race, for example, the second-choice votes for the fourth-place finisher could, when redistributed, easily push one of the top two candidates over the 50% threshold for victory. These votes then have a greater value than those cast for the third-place finisher, whose second choice is ignored. A runoff election is a much fairer way to produce a winner with a majority instead of a plurality of votes.
Prof. Philip B. Eppard

You fail to mention RCV’s most antidemocratic feature, which is that ranking a candidate higher may actually cause that candidate to lose—strange as it sounds. This can happen because of RCV’s sequential elimination of weaker candidates and the transfer of their votes to stronger candidates who remain in the race. In this complicated shift of votes, the voter can, in addition, sometimes do better by not voting for a favorite candidate, who would have lost if the voter had him or her first. Such perverse effects of RCV are antithetical to the idea that more support for a candidate should never hurt and generally help. 
Some of these effects were observed in Burlington, Vt., after it adopted RCV in 2009. It and other problems so dismayed voters that Burlington repealed RCV in 2010. 
Prof. Steven J. Brams
New York University
New York
You criticize ranked-choice voting and mention the examples of Jill Stein or Ralph Nader as spoilers. But remember Ross Perot winning nearly 19% of the popular vote in 1992, likely handing the election to Bill Clinton ? Or Democrat Joe Manchin’s win over Republican Patrick Morrissey in West Virginia two years ago, due in no small measure to a third-party candidate securing 4% of the vote?
Ranked-choice voting doesn’t automatically favor any political party. If your state, county or city is largely center right, then ranked-choice voting will favor candidates who are center right. On the flip side, if your voters are center left then center-left candidates will be elected. It’s that simple.
Sen. Susan Collins’s win in Maine is living proof: Ranked-choice voting elections give voters the power to elect the candidate with the widest and deepest support. In this election, that candidate was Susan Collins. We don’t need to fear ranked-choice voting elections—we need to have faith in conservative candidates to win with a majority vote and empower voters to decide who best represents them.

Mr. Lockhart and Ms. Nassour are respectively former chairs of the Republican Party in Utah and Massachusetts.
Let me offer an alternative to ranked-choice voting: Putting “none of the above” on the ballot as an additional choice for voters. If “none of the above” won a majority of the votes (in a three-way race, “none of the above” would have to earn more votes than any other candidate), then a new election would have to be held within 90 days, without any of the candidates who ran on the previous ballot.

2020/11/08,Covid: A Public-Assistance Reform Opening,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-a-public-assistance-reform-opening-11604865553,"“States Are Facing Historic Cash Crisis” (Page One, Oct. 29) highlights the critical need for states to move aggressively to modernize service delivery to citizens. The federal government, which sets many of the rules for administering public assistance, should give states the ability to innovate. In fact, during the current pandemic, some three dozen states have taken advantage of program flexibilities authorized as part of the national pandemic relief, in particular related to unemployment insurance (UI). The results have been extraordinary: faster service, reduced backlogs and greater financial transparency. Other programs, such as the food stamp or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, have seen the same increased demand but haven’t yet been given the same flexibility that has proved so helpful to UI.
The key is to extend that flexibility and more on a permanent basis. Whether it is more integrated eligibility, additional sharing of data among agencies or expanded partnerships that take advantage of innovative private-sector solutions, the opportunities and options are many. Moreover, such reforms can be done while protecting the interests of beneficiaries and taxpayers alike.
If we have learned one thing from this crisis, it is that service requires a multisector approach and that arbitrary restrictions based on old concepts are no longer acceptable. It is a lesson we need to act on.

However, he doesn’t mention where the source of much of the failure in critical thinking comes from: academia, especially the humanities and social sciences. “Postmodern” thought, “social constructivism,” “narratives” and “personal truth” have supplanted critical thinking—the use of facts and logic to support one’s position. It’s even been suggested that logic has its roots in (wait for it) “white privilege,” and anyone who offers a rational argument that is not commensurate with victim culture is somehow racist.

2020/11/09,How Vaccines Prove Their Safety,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-vaccines-prove-their-safety-11604964023,"As acute and infectious disease neurologists, we are often asked if a vaccine is safe. Pfizer’s announcement Monday that its Covid-19 vaccine is 90% effective makes the question even more pertinent. Earlier this year, two late-stage clinical trials, from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, were briefly paused after reports of neurological concerns in individual study participants. Each of these rare instances was carefully scrutinized as an adverse event—a serious clinical observation that requires review by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board.
At least two patients were initially thought to have developed transverse myelitis, a condition in which the patient’s immune system attacks the spinal cord. Similar autoimmune responses can affect the nervous system in conditions that mimic multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barré syndrome, both of which can cause paralysis. Non-neurological complications such as anaphylaxis are also possible, related also to a vaccine’s misdirected effect on the immune system. 
The purpose of listing potential adverse effects is not to create a list of reasons to avoid vaccines. These disorders are rare, and most cases spontaneously occur in otherwise healthy people who haven’t recently been vaccinated. Thus when a subject in a trial develops one of these disorders, it is often unclear whether the vaccine has anything to do with it.
In randomized clinical trials, industry sponsors and trial committees don’t necessarily know if a particular patient has received the vaccine. Patients and doctors often don’t know. Depending on the trial design, they might have received a placebo or an already approved vaccine as part of the control group. That means that in every one of these rare events, researchers must establish whether the afflicted patient received the Covid vaccine, another vaccine or no vaccine at all. 
At the same time, a detailed review is required to characterize the event in the first place. Neurological diseases aren’t always straightforward: What looks like a seizure may turn out to be something else. It’s entirely possible that a given event is what it appears to be, and is a side effect of the vaccine. But since these diseases occur in the general population, one has to determine whether the clinical disease was likely related to the study intervention or not.
The broader public can rest assured that randomized trial data will help answer all these questions and provide a sound basis for what to expect when the vaccine is administered to the general population. Many companies have made significant efforts to enroll patients in countries around the world with particular attention to diverse populations. But even the largest of these trials enrolled 50,000 to 100,000 patients. The World Health Organization suggests that the inactivated influenza vaccine is associated with one to two cases of Guillain-Barré per 100,000 patients—a rate of 0.001% to 0.002%. Put that in perspective: If a Covid-19 vaccine were as safe as the widely accepted flu shot, then 100 million vaccinated would correspond to 1,000 cases of Guillain-Barré. But 1,000 cases sounds like a much bigger number than 0.001%.
Whatever the real-world rates of complications turn out to be, they have to be placed in the context of what we know an effective vaccine will do: prevent death, disability and disruption from Covid-19. Recent surveys suggest that 20% to 30% of Americans say that they may not get a Covid-19 vaccine—twice that among minority populations, which have been disproportionately hit by the disease. How can public-health authorities reassure people that the vaccine will be safe and effective?
We will soon learn more about the precise safety and efficacy data from closely watched large-scale trials. Scientific review and transparent results will be critical. While doing no harm is the bedrock principle of clinical care, virtually all treatments have some unintended consequences. No matter how few patients are affected by adverse events, we must acknowledge that they may occur. When they do, it will be important to have a population-level reporting structure that evaluates events carefully so they can be rigorously reviewed. Federal agencies should guide, track and review adverse events. Adverse events should be reviewed not only by industry sponsors but by disease experts who have access to primary data, empowered through public health authorities. Regular reporting should be widely available to the scientific and clinical communities as well as the broader public.
There are many reasons to be optimistic. In the modern era, highly innovative biological approaches to vaccine development such as the use of mRNA platforms are being deployed at an unparalleled scale. It is possible that these newer platforms will provide unprecedented safety and efficacy profiles for vaccines. This innovation is the direct result of years of investment in biomedical research and a bold commercial biopharmaceutical landscape. 
It’s likely that this won’t be the last time our society has to do this. Improving our ability to implement a successful scientific advancement in the community will pay lasting dividends for public health.

2020/11/09,"Democrats, Let Progressives Lead",Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-let-progressives-lead-11604963976,"Will there ever be accountability for Democrats? The establishment wing of the party blew one election to Donald Trump and came to the precipice of blowing another. Were there any lessons learned from 2016? Nope. Same guys, same mistakes. The band marches on.
Start with Chuck Schumer in the Senate. With more coronavirus cases and deaths than anywhere else in the world and a buffoonish Republican president, he couldn’t find a way to pick up three seats. That means Republicans can block any progressive legislation. Will Mr. Schumer face accountability? Of course not.
Nancy Pelosi lost seats in the House when every Democrat in the country thinks we have the worst president in history. There’s got to be some accountability for that, right? Nope. Not a chance. There is no more revered person in Washington than Mrs. Pelosi. The rest of the country sees her as a feckless elitist, but Washington sees her as a master legislator. She’s passed one major piece of legislation in her career: a health-care law whose central provision was conceived by the Heritage Foundation.
This is the same Democratic leadership that lost almost 1,000 state legislative seats nationwide to Republicans during the Obama era. That’s a large village in Kazakhstan. Was there any accountability after those failures? Nope. Still the same folks in charge.
Those losses came at a time when Democrats had major advantages on almost every issue, according to national polling. They had a significant demographic advantage and a popular president. If you can’t win then, when can you ever win? It turns out the answer is hardly ever.
The national media has seen all of this unfold but rarely commented on it. There was no reckoning after Hillary Clinton’s historic loss. It was blamed on James Comey, the Russians, the Bernie Bros., the weather, the dog that ate our votes. A question for the Democrats: Did you ever consider that maybe, just maybe, it was actually you? But the media didn’t ask. They’re all in the same establishment together. Criticizing the corporate wing of the Democratic Party would feel like criticizing themselves.
Democratic leaders have been outclassed by Republican politicians, whom I loathe, for their entire careers. How many losses can the Democrats pile up, how many easy elections can they bungle, before someone asks: Hey, are we sure these are the right guys?
Will it happen now? Very unlikely. The members of this establishment all know and like each other. Most important, they have the same interest in protecting the status quo, which has empowered and enriched them. That’s why they’ll continue to pretend there is no problem and that the Democratic Party was always supposed to serve corporate donors and lose easy elections.
Progressives have a message for establishment Democrats: Get out of the way. We know how to fight Republicans. We know how to make our case. We know how to fight for our voters. You obviously can’t do the job, so let us do it!

2020/11/09,Joe Biden’s Bitter Harvest,Main Street,https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-bidens-bitter-harvest-11604963930,"“Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end.” So spoke Joe Biden Saturday night in a speech that was as much a call for unity as a celebration of victory.
If Mr. Biden means it, he will need to show it. He might start by stating that there’s no place in his administration for anyone who joins in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s call for a de facto blacklist of Trump supporters. This might upset some of Mr. Biden’s supporters, but that’s leadership. It’s essential even if Mr. Trump and some of his supporters make it no easier by insisting, after the litigation is exhausted and the results certified, that Mr. Biden hasn’t been legitimately elected.

Wherever would Mr. Trump and his supporters get such an idea? Maybe from those who spent the past four years undermining the legitimacy of the Trump presidency.
Here’s Hillary Clinton from September 2019, nearly three years after her defeat: “He knows he’s an illegitimate president. I believe he understands that the many varying tactics they used, from voter suppression and voter purging to hacking to the false stories, he knows that there were just a bunch of different reasons why the election turned out like it did.”
Or Jimmy Carter in June 2019. “There’s no doubt that the Russians did interfere in the election. And I think the interference, although not yet quantified, if fully investigated would show that Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.” Asked if that meant he regarded Mr. Trump as an “illegitimate president,” Mr. Carter said yes. 
In January 2017, Rep. Jerrold Nadler said he was boycotting Mr. Trump’s inauguration (along with one-third of his fellow House Democrats) because, though the president was “legally elected,” he wasn’t “legitimate.” During impeachment, another effort to reject the 2016 election, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House had no choice but to act because Mr. Trump was “trying to corrupt, once again, the election for his benefit.” Not to mention the ridiculous attempts to paint a candidate who attracted more minority votes than any Republican in recent history as a champion of white supremacy.
Mr. Biden piled on with the rest of them. In the first debate he called Mr. Trump a “racist,” building on his earlier claim that Mr. Trump was America’s first racist president. During a May 2019 campaign stop in New Hampshire, a woman came up to Mr. Biden and said Mr. Trump was “an illegitimate president in my mind.” Mr. Biden’s response? “I absolutely agree.”
These aren’t MSNBC hosts or activists. They are Democratic Party leaders. Frankly, it would be difficult to find a prominent Democrat who didn’t accuse Mr. Trump of being an illegitimately elected president. It’s no coincidence the president’s critics styled themselves “the resistance.”
Those Trump supporters who are sure this election has been stolen—are they any different from the 33% of Hillary Clinton voters who, according to a poll taken immediately after Election Day 2016, said they didn’t believe Mr. Trump was legitimately elected? And might Trump voters be a little skeptical about demands for evidence from the same people who spent years accusing Mr. Trump of being a Russian agent without any evidence whatsoever?
Right now the president is demanding recounts and holding off conceding until the litigation has concluded and the results certified, which is his right. But if the result still goes against him and he responds by boycotting Mr. Biden’s inauguration or insisting he was cheated, it won’t go well for him. One look at Hillary Clinton, still sadly refusing to concede she lost in 2016, should tell him that.
But what fate has in store for Mr. Trump is less important for America’s future than what it holds for his voters. More Americans cast their votes for Mr. Trump than for any presidential candidate in American history—except Mr. Biden. Over the past four years, this half of America has been treated as the deplorables that Mrs. Clinton called them, with MAGA hats regarded as the 21st-century equivalent of white hoods. 
It isn’t over, either. At the same moment Mr. Biden is being applauded for his Lincolnesque call to come together, Michelle Obama, in her own congratulatory message, reminded Mr. Biden that millions of Trump voters chose to support “lies, hate, chaos, and division.” Mrs. Obama appears not to have got the memo about not demonizing people on the other side.
Mr. Biden’s words on Saturday were exactly what the country needed to hear. But if the 71 million Americans who voted for Mr. Trump are to be reconciled, they will need to be persuaded. And for this to happen, Mr. Biden will at some point need to acknowledge the seeds he and his supporters sowed to help bring us to this bitter harvest.

2020/11/09,This Isn’t Obama’s Middle East,Global View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-isnt-obamas-middle-east-11604963875,"Even in the closing weeks of America’s presidential campaign, the grisly murder of French schoolteacher Samuel Paty made an impression. As part of a civics lesson, Mr. Paty showed his class of 13-year-olds the Charlie Hebdo caricatures of the prophet Muhammad. Soon afterward, Mr. Paty was attacked and beheaded in the street. President Emmanuel Macron, whose government has been moving right on law and order as the electoral competition with Marine Le Pen of the National Rally heats up, announced a series of measures aimed at limiting what he called “Islamist separatism.” 
The reaction from Muslim religious and political leaders around the world ranged from supportive (the United Arab Emirates and some imams) to perfunctory (Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) to sulfurous, with Malaysian former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad helpfully tweeting that Muslims had the right to kill “millions of French people” in retribution for French colonialism. 

But the most significant reaction came from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country is embroiled in confrontations with France in the Eastern Mediterranean. “Macron needs mental treatment,” Mr. Erdogan said, calling for a Turkish boycott against French products. “What is the problem of this person Macron with Muslims and Islam?” 
That a controversy over Islamism should turn into a diplomatic standoff between Turkey and France highlights the dramatic changes in the Middle East and the Mediterranean that the incoming Biden administration will have to address. Since the Democrats were last in office, Saudi Arabia has begun to disengage from the business of supporting radical Islamism, and Turkey and Qatar have picked up the fallen banner. When Europeans these days talk about foreign funding for radical preachers, Turkey is often the source. And when Gulf Arabs like the Emiratis talk about the danger of radical Islamist regimes, they worry more about Turkey even than Iran. 
What we are looking at is the rise of a new transregional alignment. Think of it as the Axis of Abraham, linking Mr. Macron’s France with Greece, Cyprus, Israel and the U.A.E. While some observers have pooh-poohed the new peace agreements between the Gulf Arabs and Israel (and the clear Saudi support for them) as empty theater intended to help prop up President Trump, in reality the Abraham Accords reflect a major shift in regional dynamics. 
The Gulf Arabs now see their own security organically linked to Israel and intend not only to exchange ambassadors but to work with the Israelis on securing the region. This means, among other things, a change in their relationship with radical Islamist groups. A House of Saud that permits Israeli commercial flights over its territory cannot simultaneously serve as the champion of hard-line Salafism. 
For the French, who worry about Turkey’s support for radical Islamist separatist groups within France as well as its role in Libya and the eastern Mediterranean, the U.A.E. is a natural partner. The two countries have longstanding defense and economic ties, and with the U.S. apparently looking to reduce its profile in the Middle East as Turkey throws its weight around, their common interests are growing. 
For Democrats, this is complicated. Mr. Erdogan has long-lasting and close ties with the Muslim Brotherhood—a group that enjoyed close relations with the Obama administration, which helped pave the way for the short-lived Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt under former President Mohammed Morsi. Some Democrats continue to see groups like the Brotherhood as potential partners for America against more-radical and violent groups like al Qaeda and ISIS as well as authoritarian rulers like Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and the Gulf royals.
Meanwhile, one of the strongest impulses in Democratic foreign-policy thinking is animosity against Saudi Arabia, a mostly silent but highly influential member of the emerging new axis. The lack of human rights in the kingdom, its long record of supporting dangerous currents in the world of radical Islamism, its deep ties to GOP stalwarts like the Bush family, and its role as a lead producer of fossil fuels all rub Democrats the wrong way. Bitter Saudi opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and its icy relations with the Obama administration—and warm relations with Mr. Trump—don’t help. 
The emerging Axis of Abraham connecting France, Israel and the U.A.E. may well be the best partner for the U.S. going forward, but the road ahead is not easy. The Emiratis, Saudis and Israelis want a say in any new negotiations with Iran and will be working with the Trump administration in its closing weeks to create new facts on the ground. Turkey remains a member of NATO and there are good reasons why America might prefer to narrow rather than widen the gap with Ankara. Russia, bracing for an adversarial relationship with the new administration, will play the spoiler where it can. Iran still has its centrifuges and network of regional proxies. 
The Middle East will not and should not be the incoming Biden administration’s highest foreign-policy priority. But getting it right is going to take some hard thinking.

2020/11/09,"In My Yard, Every Critter Gets a Handout",Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-my-yard-every-critter-gets-a-handout-11604963792,"It started with a few slices of leftover bread tossed from our porch. As we closed our weekend house Sunday evenings, I’d give the birds a parting snack. I tore up the crusty pieces into bite-size portions. Over time, a few crows and starlings huddled on the phone line over our yard waiting for us to get on the road. The offering was always gone by the time we returned.
I noticed an inviting spot under the maple tree across the street. One of the roots had a hollowed-out section, creating a dry, canopied shelter. I deposited bread crumbs, croutons, berries, almonds and pecans in the little nook for the birds and rodents to enjoy after we’d left. My wife, Sarah, started calling me Boo Radley.
Since March, we’ve been spending extended time at the house, avoiding New York’s density during the pandemic. The animals have noticed, especially since there are fewer departures and I’ve increased the feedings. Now, I merely step onto my porch in the morning to walk the dog and am greeted by a committee of fur and feathers cawing and squealing for their treats. Instead of Boo Radley, I feel like Ace Ventura.
Sometimes my charges get a little—entitled. The crows strut around the lawn like Hitchcock extras. Or I’m awakened before dawn by scampering squirrel feet on our roof. “Tell your friends what time it is,” Sarah snarls.
But I get to watch the mealtime show all week long. A blue jay arrives first on a branch and calls for reinforcements before dive-bombing into the nook for goodies. The squirrels barely wait for the nut bag to empty before they converge, running around with their prizes and screeching at one another over seconds. A brilliant lone cardinal swoops in and snatches a helping. Sparrows, bluebirds and a fly-by kingfisher get their portions, as do a pair of chipmunks at warp speed. Even a woodpecker shimmies down from atop the tree, but heads back up for insects.
We’ve long had beasts around our house—though the mice, ants and spiders in residence aren’t exactly invited. Ditto the raccoon who broke through our kitchen screen and smeared footprints over the sofa as it made off with a fresh challah. But I feel an obligation to the foragers who visit openly in the light of day and call for refills. Am I crazy to think that bushy tail waves for me?
Cross-species bonding has a price. Over the summer, a bird family nested in our attic and made a mess of the insulation. In October, our upstairs heat fritzed out and the repair guys spent days tracing the source of an electric short. “Looks like some critters chewed the wire—you may have a squirrel issue,” they said. I only nodded. The bill was $600.
Sarah and I were back in the city recently, but our daughter remained at the house. Emily is allergic to nuts, so I texted her husband asking if he’d be my feeding proxy. No answer—I assumed Raffa had more important things to manage with two small children and Zoom calls. But the next morning he replied: “The squirrels have been served pistachios. Unsalted.” For a brief moment, the world was in a good place.

2020/11/09,The Covid Vaccine Cavalry,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-covid-vaccine-cavalry-11604963056,"Pfizer’s announcement Monday that its vaccine for Covid-19 was 90% effective in late-stage trials is the best news of a dismal 2020. If the interim results hold, this could lead to a mid-2021 pandemic exit—and perhaps spare us from the lockdown instincts of the coronavirus team that Joe Biden announced Monday.
The 90% rate is far above most expectations. The Food and Drug Administration has set a 50% effectiveness rate for considering expedited approval, and Europe has said it may approve a vaccine that is less than 50% effective. Annual flu vaccines are only 30% to 60% effective, and that’s in a good year. The 90% rate of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would put it nearly on par with the measles vaccine, and it may also work with older people. This is not always the case with vaccines.
Pfizer said there were no safety issues from its trials and that it could apply to the FDA as early as this month for expedited approval to distribute the drug. This also bodes well for the vaccine being developed by Moderna, the biotech startup, that is also in Phase 3 trials. Both vaccines use a new technology platform known as mRNA, or messenger RNA, that carries genetic instructions to cells.
The apparent breakthrough is a credit to the innovative capacity of the private pharmaceutical industry. Pfizer has developed the vaccine using its own capital. That requires making a return on investment, which the politicians in both parties should keep in mind when they promise price controls on drugs. That would mean fewer resources to tackle the next coronavirus or deadly disease.
The contribution from Operation Warp Speed, the Trump Administration vaccine effort, will nonetheless be critical in distributing a vaccine to market. The feds have promised Pfizer $1.95 billion to deliver 100 million doses to the federal government that will then be given to Americans free of charge. 
Health-care workers and Americans most at risk are likely to receive the vaccine first, but if all goes well it could be available to most Americans by as early as April. This means the U.S. could reach herd immunity faster than most of the experts anticipated. 
The financial markets certainly looked on the bright side Monday by sending stocks soaring on the vaccine news. Companies that have suffered under lockdowns and slower economic growth saw their prices rise sharply on the day, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 3%. 
The vaccine news, assuming it holds, also vindicates President Trump’s oft-expressed optimism. He had hoped this breakthrough would come in October, before Election Day, and he was off by a week. He can still take credit for mobilizing the government to accelerate the approval of vaccines and therapies in what is likely to be record time. He streamlined bureaucratic reporting lines and prodded the FDA to collaborate with vaccine developers to consider results in nearly real time.
Mr. Biden welcomed the Pfizer news in a statement, albeit without any credit to Mr. Trump, and he announced the members of an advisory committee on the virus. Our concern is that the list includes members who are highly partisan and believers in government mandates and slow drug approvals.
Committee co-chair David Kessler ran the FDA during the George H.W. Bush and Clinton Administrations and paid more attention to Capitol Hill than to the imperatives of medical innovation. He fought silicone breast implants based on little scientific evidence and onerous delays in approving medical devices.
 Ezekiel Emanuel has advocated extreme lockdowns during the pandemic no matter the economic or public-health harm. On June 30 he told MSNBC: “You have to actually have people at home, close nonessential businesses, stop bars, stop indoor dining, have everyone wearing face masks. These are the things we need to do. And, by the way, just doing it in isolated places is not going to solve it either. You need to do it nationwide.” 
As recently as July 29, he wrote in the New York Times that “schools should open only in places that have fewer than 75 confirmed cases per 100,000 people cumulatively over the previous seven days, and that have a test positivity rate below 5 percent.” Even countries in Europe that are locking down again are keeping schools open as the evidence is clear that children are largely not vulnerable. 
The other potential problem is if politicians frighten the public into not being vaccinated. Mr. Biden and Kamala Harris fed those fears in the campaign, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo popped off Monday that it’s “bad news” that the Trump Administration will be distributing the vaccine because it will use traditional health-care channels. Didn’t Mr. Biden say the election is over?
Americans have been suffering for nearly nine months from the pandemic, and the vaccine news offers hope that an end could be in sight. The reaction should be cautious optimism and cooperation, not partisan scare tactics.

2020/11/09,ObamaCare Returns to the Supremes,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/obamacare-returns-to-the-supremes-11604963006,"Perhaps you heard during the election campaign that President Trump’s Supreme Court Justices were poised to kill ObamaCare. Well, the Justices hear that case on Tuesday, and the result is likely to show how false that claim was. 
Republican state Attorneys General joined by individual plaintiffs argue in California v. Texas that the Affordable Care Act should be overturned since the GOP’s 2017 tax reform zeroed out the penalty for not maintaining health insurance. While their argument is likely to fail, the case offers the Court a chance to do a constitutional stitch in time.
In 2012 the Court ruled 5-4 that the ACA’s individual mandate violated the Constitution. The parchment grants states, not the federal government, police powers to command individuals. Chief Justice John Roberts nonetheless rescued the law by joining with four liberals in holding that the mandate penalty could be construed as a tax because it raised revenue.
In 2017 Republicans zeroed out the mandate penalty as part of tax reform. We’ve long argued that the mandate’s coercive power was overestimated. But Democrats insisted until recently that the ObamaCare health exchanges would implode without it. Republican AGs picked up and ran with this argument. They claim that, without a penalty for not carrying insurance, the mandate is no longer a tax. Ergo, the mandate is unconstitutional and, because it is supposedly essential to the exchanges, the whole law must fall. 
The Trump Administration committed legal and political malpractice by endorsing this flawed argument. This let liberals demagogue about protections for pre-existing conditions and left Democratic Attorneys General to defend the law in court. Their argument defending the mandate is also dubious. 
According to California and its liberal friends, the mandate stripped of the penalty is now a mere exhortation and individual choice. Therefore it is still 100% constitutionally kosher. But this ignores that the statute uses the unambiguous command “shall,” making it unconstitutional with or without the penalty.
California tries to give the Chief a way out of having to maneuver around his earlier opinion by arguing the plaintiffs don’t have standing since they haven’t been harmed by the penalty’s elimination, even though they say they wouldn’t buy insurance if not for the mandate.
The standing question need not keep the Court from striking down the mandate—especially because Congress could in the future reinstate the penalty. Joe Biden has said he supports doing so. The Court has a chance to make clear that Congress can’t use its taxing power as a constitutional end-run to impose other mandates on individuals.
At the same time, there’s no valid legal argument for overturning the entire ACA. The GOP Congress surgically zeroed out the penalty, thereby severing it from the law. Premiums and enrollment in the exchanges have since been stable, so the mandate is clearly not essential to insurance markets.
The economic reliance interests on the ACA have also grown since 2012, as amicus briefs from hospitals, physician groups and insurers attest. We have long opposed the law and in 2012 argued it should be overturned, but that job now lies with Congress, not the courts.

2020/11/09,Canceling Trump Alumni,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/canceling-trump-alumni-11604962923,"Before the election, some Democrats were salivating over the idea of prosecuting Trump Administration officials. Elizabeth Warren proposed a Justice Department task force to target the outgoing Administration. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich in October called for a “Truth and Reconciliation Commission.”
Assuming Republicans hold their Senate majority, the most vindictive Democratic officials may find it hard to be confirmed for top positions in a Biden Justice Department. Yet even if they can’t corrupt the legal system, some progressives want to harness their cultural power to punish public officials who served the country over the last four years.
Last Friday former Democratic National Committee Press Secretary Hari Sevugan tweeted that “employers considering [Trump White House staff] should know there are consequences for hiring anyone who helped Trump attack American values.” He shared a link to a new website called “The Trump Accountability Project”—apparently an initiative to make unemployable anyone associated with the Trump Administration or campaign.
 Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez called in a tweet for “archiving these Trump sycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in the future.” Does she want them to wear a scarlet “T” on their chest?
Let’s hope this fanaticism has limited reach. So far Joe Biden has set a good example, declaring that President Trump’s supporters “are not our enemies. They are Americans.” Yet we’ve learned in recent years not to underestimate the left’s ability to intimidate corporations, universities, nonprofits, media and other institutions. Some may block Trump officials they might otherwise hire to avoid revolts by progressive young employees.
That would be a shame—less for the Trump alumni than for the country. Most of these officials are patriots. They helped navigate foreign-policy changes in Asia and the Middle East. They helped steer economic and regulatory policy to faster growth and through a pandemic-induced recession. At critical moments, they also restrained Mr. Trump’s worst excesses. 
Americans should be grateful that someone was willing to take these jobs. More than 71 million Americans voted for Mr. Trump this year, after some 63 million did the first time. Voting in such numbers is a sign of democratic legitimacy that the left claims to respect. If liberals try to banish former Trump officials from civil society, we’ll know their pining for a less divisive politics was a calculating lie.

2020/11/09,Alex Trebek,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/alex-trebek-11604962876,"Game show hosts aren’t usually the subject of editorials, but we’ll make an exception for Alex Trebek, the longtime “Jeopardy” host who died Sunday at age 80 after a bout with pancreatic cancer. Millions of Americans will miss the man who presided over a 30-minute cerebral diversion from life’s daily consternation.
Born in Ontario, Trebek was a journalist before he began hosting game shows. In 1984 the producer Merv Griffin gave him the chance to host a revival of “Jeopardy,” and Trebek’s run in that role lasted 37 years and more than 8,200 episodes. He had an authoritative manner that was also reassuring. He didn’t condescend like a know-it-all but he also didn’t patronize wrong answers.
This fit a show in which success is based on merit. You either know the answer in a split second or you don’t. Not everyone gets a trophy, and there are no equal outcomes. The winner knows the most and is quicker on the button. Millions of viewers liked to test their own knowledge by playing along, and thousands who did so went on to be contestants on the show.
In a media world that is increasingly splintered into niche shows and markets, “Jeopardy” stands out for its long run and continuing national popularity. Much of that success owes to Trebek, who also gave viewers a lesson in fortitude as he confronted his cancer diagnosis with grace and good humor. A philanthropist in private life, he offered viewers updates on his treatment and taped his last show as recently as Oct. 29.

2020/11/09,"So Long, Shutdowns",Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/so-long-shutdowns-11604943964,"The global pharmaceutical industry, so unloved by politicians of all stripes, appears to have triumphed over another enemy of human health. U.S. drug giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech say that initial data suggest their coronavirus vaccine is a winner. Other promising vaccine candidates developed by other companies should also yield results soon. Here’s hoping the world’s bureaucracies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, can manage to avoid standing in the way of what appears to be a major advancement in disease prevention. 
“The moment the world has been waiting for is finally within reach,” writes the Journal’s Charley Grant. He adds:
Americans forced to stay at home will no doubt be celebrating, though there are caveats. The Pfizer results have not yet been subject to peer review and the company continues to collect information on its trials. Also, this vaccine requires extreme cold storage so distribution presents a logistical challenge and for this reason it’s possible that other vaccine candidates, if effective, may be more widely used. But the Pfizer results so far suggest a huge win for the relief of human suffering.
Katie Thomas, David Gelles and Carl Zimmer report in the New York Times:
A lot of media folk lambasted President Trump for predicting such a result, but thank goodness he appears to have been right on target. Still, Pfizer makes the case that this is a market triumph, not a government triumph. According to the Times: 
That’s the spirit, although it’s clear that the feds have funded a number of Covid research efforts. UPDATE: And it turns out that the Pfizer vaccine is indeed part of the program, as Pfizer itself noted in a July press release:
Now that all the votes have been cast Mr. Trump’s opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, will likely be more comfortable acknowledging how similar his Covid plan is to the Trump plan. During the campaign Mr. Biden shamefully claimed that Mr. Trump was responsible for U.S. virus deaths. Now there seems to be an implicit acknowledgment that Team Biden agrees with the White House on key aspects of the federal response and doesn’t want to disrupt them. Reuters reports:
If Mr. Biden is certified as the winner of the election, he and all Americans will be able to enjoy a rebounding economy and an increasingly effective medical response to Covid. The latter will directly save many lives and indirectly save more by making it nearly impossible for state and local politicians to maintain their misguided lockdowns.

2020/11/10,The Supreme Court’s Pennsylvania Cleanup,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-supreme-courts-pennsylvania-cleanup-11605050501,"For a few days last week, it looked as if the 2020 election might play out as a gloomy opera of recounts and lawsuits, possibly upstaging Florida in 2000. We can thank the fates for sparing us, since nobody else can claim credit. The task ahead, starting in the Supreme Court, is to prevent a similar shadow from falling next time.
Joe Biden’s lead in Pennsylvania has plodded upward to about 49,000 votes, at last check. That’s a modest margin of 0.73 percentage point, but it’s enough to avoid a recount cataclysm. The potential, though, was there. Pennsylvania law says absentee votes must be returned by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Two months ago, the state’s highest court nonetheless yelled abracadabra and changed the deadline to Nov. 6, while making postmarks optional.
Those straggling ballots remain subject to litigation, and Justice Samuel Alito has ordered local officials to keep them separate. The precise number of late votes hasn’t been released, but a state official said Tuesday that it’s “approximately 10,000.” If Mr. Biden were winning by 537 votes, which was George W. Bush’s final margin in Florida, all hell would break loose. The Court’s decision to invalidate the ballots, or to count them, might well pick the next President.
Now the temptation for the Justices, since Mr. Biden appears to have won Pennsylvania and the White House, will be to call this case moot and walk away from the controversy. That would be a missed opportunity. 
First, it matters for posterity whether Mr. Biden won the state by 49,000 or something closer to 43,000, or whatever. Settling the issue would remove one of Donald Trump’s claims of electoral shenanigans. Most important, however, is straightening out all the lower judges who see the Constitution’s elections clauses as useless inkblots.
In recent cases, state and federal courts across the country ignored black-letter election law. With Nov. 3 looming, judges extended the statutory ballot deadlines by three days in Georgia, six in Wisconsin and 14 in Michigan. Those orders were halted on appeal. After Minnesota progressives sued, a Democratic official agreed to bump the ballot deadline by a week, state law be damned. An appeals court responded, five days before the election, by ordering that Minnesota’s late ballots be kept separate, leaving a second batch of votes in limbo.
The Supreme Court has already yanked the reins on the federal judiciary. Last month it restored South Carolina’s witness requirement for absentee ballots, which a federal judge had suspended. Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s opinion there was cited days later, when an appeals court halted the Wisconsin deadline extension.
It’s trickier, in a federalist system, to correct state judges on a question of state law. But Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court doesn’t have free rein, especially given how far it strayed. The U.S. Constitution vests state legislatures with authority over elections, and Pennsylvania lawmakers set an unequivocal ballot deadline. 
Where did the state judges find the power to overrule it? They gestured at a provision of the state constitution, which vaguely says that elections “shall be free and equal.”
Liberals say it would be a watershed for the Justices to overrule a state court’s interpretation of an election code in this way. But intervening here would not obligate the Supreme Court to wade into state election disputes that involve genuine ambiguity. It would merely put state judges on notice that they can’t outright stomp on clear election rules that were duly passed by legislatures accountable to the people.
Uncertainty is unavoidable when running an election during a pandemic. Yet rewriting the rules at the last minute made this election a much riskier proposition than it needed to be. Candidates and voters went into Nov. 3 knowing that the ballot requirements in Pennsylvania and other states might be changed after the fact. If it had rained in Philadelphia last week, making Mr. Biden’s turnout soggy, the country might be on the brink of a Bush v. Gore redux over those thousands of late ballots, with an outcome that half the country would call illegitimate.
This is no way to run an election for junior-high student council, much less the world’s oldest functioning democracy. A Supreme Court decision in the Pennsylvania case might not determine the outcome in this election. But the country deserves better in the years to come than a repeat of 2020’s last-minute, arbitrary rule changes. The Justices can help by making the Constitution’s commands clear to judges and politicians.

2020/11/10,Republicans and Democrats Could Use Some Soul Searching,Future View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-and-democrats-could-use-some-soul-searching-11605050760,"Editor’s note: In this Future View, students discuss what each U.S. political party can learn from the past election. Next week we’ll ask, “Are Republicans making a mistake by challenging the results of the presidential election?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Nov. 17. The best responses will be published that night.
America Is in the Middle
One clear message from this election is that moderate politics still has a voice in the U.S. After four years, it appears that voters have rejected the polarizing presidency of Donald Trump in favor of a candidate who campaigned on a return to civility and will likely govern methodically instead of unpredictably. At the same time, with a surprisingly strong Republican showing in Senate and House elections, the nation also rejected the radical structural changes promoted by the left, including court packing, elimination of the filibuster, and adding new states to the union as a political power grab.
Joe Biden will need to decide whether he wants his presidency to be defined by symbolic executive orders or substantive legislative victories. The latter will require failing progressive purity tests, reaching across the aisle, and finding bipartisan agreement. Likewise, with an unfavorable Senate map in 2022, Republicans would be wise to look for legislative successes and avoid becoming the party of blind resistance. Though Presidents Obama and Trump both failed to move laws through a divided legislature, I am optimistic that Mr. Biden’s experience in the Senate will prepare him for success. We could be on the brink of a new era of compromise and bipartisanship in U.S. politics.
—Jacob Saldinger, University of Michigan, chemical engineering (Ph.D.)
The Libertarian Moment . . . for Self-Reflection
Everyone knew the names Donald Trump and Joe Biden this past election season. But how many American voters had heard of Jo Jorgensen ? The Libertarian Party candidate received a little more than 1% of the popular vote, a showing that ranked as the LP’s second-best finish ever.
The low number remains disappointing for those of us who are liberty-minded, but there’s an important lesson here. Many people are dispositionally libertarian. They’re tired of “forever wars.” They want to be left to their own devices, and they’d rather not pay so much in taxes, all things considered. The party’s philosophy is compelling; its optics, however, are not. Asking voters to trust the LP, after so many public-image issues over the years, is a tall order. Unfortunately, the Libertarian Party is doomed to be taken only as seriously as it takes itself.
For now the LP needs to focus on helping its candidates at the state and local levels. That way, Americans can learn that Libertarians can help change their lives for the better. In an era when every presidential election seems more important than the last, that sort of credibility will help voters trust Libertarian candidates with more prestigious offices.
In yet another election in which Americans were essentially asked to pick between the lesser of two evils, the Libertarian Party was handed a golden opportunity. For the sake of a nation that so badly needs a viable third party, let’s hope that this is a wake-up call.
—Fiona Harrigan, University of Arizona, political science
Dangerous Paths
Republicans and Democrats alike need to do some soul searching. Four years after reluctantly unifying behind Donald Trump, the GOP has undeniably been shaped in his image. On a positive note, and to many liberals’ dismay, this helped the party gain a significant number of disgruntled Latino and African-American voters. At the same time, Republicans have been engulfed by antigovernment conspiracy theories. They refuse to accept the result of the election, playing the sore loser.
It’s a dangerous and unenviable line to walk. Are Republicans content with becoming more Dale Gribble than Hank Hill? Seeing as the GOP lost the referendum on Mr. Trump yet gained seats in the House and probably maintained control of the Senate, they should be inclined to return to the mainstream.
Democrats need to figure out whether they want to fully embrace the democratic-socialist brand or ditch it. As many votes as they gained from Bernie Sanders’s progressives, they assuredly lost from moderates and, in Florida, Latinos who detest socialism. But that cannot mean spoon-feeding to their base a candidate that few are motivated by, as the Democrats have done in the past two elections.
—Alexander Hinestrosa, Columbia University, economics
Trumpism’s Farewell
After President Trump’s defeat, the Republican Party needs to do some distancing from Trumpism. The election results suggest voters still see Republican candidates and conservative politics as attractive—but not Mr. Trump’s brand of politics. In spite of the president’s loss, the GOP managed to win seats in the House and, in all likelihood, maintain its Senate majority. Mr. Trump lost, but conservatism didn’t. 
That doesn’t mean Republicans can’t learn from the Trump campaign, especially its success with minority voters. According to an NBC exit poll, Mr. Trump won 26% of the nonwhite vote, a significant improvement. He made strides in the Latino, black and Asian communities, and the election was closer as a result. Looking to the future, these gains have to be exciting for the GOP. But if outreach were to trail off, it could all be squandered.
Turning to the Democrats, President-elect Biden campaigned on not being Mr. Trump. It worked, but not by much. Mr. Trump nearly won another election he had no business winning. Instead of denouncing everyone who voted for the president as a bad person, the Democrats need to look inward. A large segment of voters are scared off by a far-left, socialist agenda. A considerable number of minority voters are tired of their vote being taken for granted. Assuming the GOP nominates a more normal candidate in 2024, the Democrats will need to persuade voters anew on policy, not personality.
—Thomas Wolfson, University of Maryland, College Park, journalism and history
A Humbler Approach
The Democratic Party needs to understand that getting on its high horse doesn’t necessarily earn votes. There’s a difference between speaking for social change and taking an elitist moral stance that alienates crucial voters. I’m a liberal, but it simply won’t do to lord contested policy positions over voters as the only morally acceptable stance. 
Republicans have worked to position themselves as the party of “everyday people.” Judging by the election results, they’ve had some success, even under difficult circumstances for the incumbents. Democrats need to match this and understand that nobody’s mind will be changed if they’re being talked down to. We need to have open conversations to educate rather than berate voters about inequalities and the policies that cement them. The second someone feels “labeled” and shuts down, no progress can be made.
—Hailey Robbins, University of Virginia, English

Partisan Identity Crisis
The buildup to 2020 saw many Republican officials and strategists worried about the future of the party after President Trump, and for good reason: The GOP turned into a cult of personality around the president. For the first time, the party didn’t even adopt a policy platform, instead choosing to support whatever Mr. Trump said. Accordingly, voters saw the presidential election as a referendum on the Trump administration. Predictably, it didn’t work out. Although Mr. Trump may remain a GOP kingmaker, or even try to run again, 2024 could look rough if Republicans don’t find values and policies to define American conservatism.
Democrats have the opposite problem with their messaging: They have too many values and policies to agree on. The primaries were dominated by infighting between those who wanted a return to the old liberalism and those who demanded rapid change to tear down social and economic barriers standing in the way of the American dream. This time the moderates prevailed and Mr. Biden eked out a victory over Mr. Trump. But as more young, diverse and progressive voters join the Democrats, the party will inevitably face its own identity crisis.

2020/11/10,A ‘Time to Heal’ Agenda,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-time-to-heal-agenda-11605050461,"Joe Biden said Saturday night that after the election “this is the time to heal in America.” In that spirit, and to be constructive, we thought we’d offer a couple of suggestions for what you might call the healing agenda. These aren’t major policy concessions, but they would have symbolic political significance.
The former Vice President could start by ending government harassment of the Little Sisters of the Poor. That’s the order of nuns who have objected for a decade to being forced to cover contraception and abortifacients in their health-care plan under ObamaCare. 
In July the Supreme Court upheld a Trump Administration rule granting the nuns a religious exemption to the mandate, but Mr. Biden criticized the ruling and vowed to restore the “Obama-Biden policy that existed before the [2014 Supreme Court] Hobby Lobby ruling.” Dropping the attempt to coerce these nuns against their beliefs wouldn’t threaten ObamaCare. But it would be an important gesture to religious Americans that Mr. Biden is going to lower the temperature in the culture war. 
Next we’d suggest ending Mr. Biden’s opposition to the Opportunity Scholarships in the District of Columbia that provide a lifeline for thousands of low-income children trapped in bad public schools. The teachers unions hate this program because it challenges their education monopoly and, under Barack Obama, Democrats killed it for a while. But especially when Covid-19 has exposed the need for more options for public-school families, declaring peace over the scholarships would help thousands of poor parents and send a message that Mr. Biden’s priority is children rather than unions. 
For a triple play, Mr. Biden could also speak up against those on the left who want to stigmatize and purge from civil society anyone who has worked in the Trump Administration. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is one of the instigators of the purge campaign. Mr. Biden doesn’t have to admire the Trump Administration to say that most of the people who have served in it did so honorably. 
This would anger some on the left, but if Mr. Biden intends to drive his Administration rather than have it driven from the left, better to send such a signal early. It won’t reconcile all Trump voters, but it might persuade many that Mr. Biden’s call for unity is more than Beltway virtue-signaling. We have many other suggestions if Mr. Biden wants to hear them.

2020/11/10,Supreme Misjudgment on ObamaCare,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-misjudgment-on-obamacare-11605050393,"Well, that didn’t go well. At least not for the state of Texas and the Trump Administration as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments Tuesday in their challenge to ObamaCare. A majority of Justices signaled that they didn’t buy the argument that the entire law should be cashiered because Congress zeroed out the tax for not having health insurance. 
Chief Justice John Roberts saved ObamaCare in 2012 by defining the mandate to buy health insurance as a tax. But in 2017 Congress eliminated the tax while preserving the rest of the law—though the mandate itself remains on the books without a penalty. Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins argued that the entire law should go down because the mandate is no longer a tax, but he ran into a judicial buzzsaw.
“I think it’s hard for you to argue that Congress intended the entire Act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same Congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the Act,” Chief Justice Roberts said to poor Mr. Hawkins. “I think, frankly, that they wanted the Court to do that. But that’s not our job.”
Justice Brett Kavanaugh made the point earlier to the lawyer defending ObamaCare: “I tend to agree with you that it’s a very straightforward case for severability under our precedents, meaning that we would excise the mandate and leave the rest of the Act in place, reading our severability precedents.”
Justice Kavanaugh has previously explained why the Court is reluctant to strike down an entire law when only part of it is unconstitutional, so his view isn’t surprising.
If you’re counting at home, this means at least five Justices are against overturning the entire law no matter what the Court rules on the tax-less mandate. The three liberals are sure to join the Chief and Justice Kavanaugh on the point. The other Justices didn’t show their hand, but we’ll guess nearly all of them will go along too.
The mystery is why this wasn’t obvious to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who was the driver of this litigation. Or to the Trump White House, which was advised by its Justice Department that it was taking a losing position—legally and politically. 
The White House went ahead anyway, giving Democrats their best policy advantage during the recent election—that the Trump appointees to the Supreme Court would cost Americans their health insurance. As Tuesday’s argument showed, this isn’t going to happen. But that won’t stop Democrats from continuing the drumbeat as they try to win two Senate seats in Georgia runoffs on Jan. 5. 
Joe Biden made the point Tuesday in remarks that sounded like a campaign speech. Too bad the Justices can’t rule on this case by the end of the week.

2020/11/10,Ponder the Rewards of Military Service,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/ponder-the-rewards-of-military-service-11605049025,"Fewer and fewer Americans are connected to the country’s all-volunteer professional military. The military’s separation from society is consequential. In a democracy, if citizens don’t understand the military, they won’t support the policies and investments necessary to secure the nation. 
Veterans Day is an opportunity to consider what compels servicemen and -women to act courageously, endure hardships, take risks and make sacrifices. For many Americans it is easy to imagine the hardships associated with military service, such as long separations from family or arduous conditions. It is more difficult to understand the less tangible rewards of service. 
One reward of service is being part of a community that sustains itself through an ethos that binds warriors to one another. That covenant is based on honor, duty, courage, loyalty and self-sacrifice. An effective military unit takes on the qualities of a family, in which the man or woman next to you is willing to give everything, even his or her own life, for you. Many veterans miss that military family when they rejoin civilian life. As the psychiatrist and author Jonathan Shay has noted, “what a returning soldier needs most when leaving war” is “a living community to whom his experience matters.” 
Another reward of service is a veteran’s pride in having exhibited courage and compassion. American veterans are both warriors and humanitarians because they engage against enemies that are a threat to all civilized peoples. Older veterans defeated Nazi fascism, Japanese imperialism and communist totalitarianism. Since the most devastating terrorist attack in history on Sept. 11, 2001, America’s younger veterans have been engaged against enemies who use a perverted interpretation of religion to promote hatred and violence against innocents. 
Veterans Day is a chance to express gratitude for the sacrifices American warriors make, but it is also an opportunity to welcome veterans into our communities and encourage them to join organizations such as nonprofits Spirit of America or Team Rubicon that bring them together with each other and their fellow citizens. A more complete view of the rewards of service might help attract young volunteers to the armed forces. 
America’s veterans have served on teams committed to excellence in which bigotry, racism and other forms of intolerance and prejudice have no place. Veterans want their fellow citizens to be bound through a sense of common purpose, mutual respect and willingness to sacrifice. Perhaps pondering the rewards of service could help Americans transcend political and social differences, regain confidence in our national character and restore pride in the republic that veterans fought to preserve.

2020/11/10,"Good Grief, the Pollsters Got It Wrong",Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/good-grief-the-pollsters-got-it-wrong-11605049069,"Too many opinion pollsters have come to resemble Lucy in the cartoon strip “Peanuts.” Ahead of the presidential elections of 2016 and 2020, they held the political football in place to tee up certain Democratic victories. But at the last second, the ball was pulled away and the entire country landed flat on its back when the Republican candidate fared much better than expected. 
It would be funny if it weren’t a sad reality that American democracy is being undermined by bad polling that consistently favors one side over the other. Though not as ingrained in our national heritage as politicians and the press, polling is an important component in the governance of the nation, as it presents snapshots of the positions Americans take on the challenges that confront us. Elected leaders, candidates for public office and constituents often rely on polling as they make their choices on issues that affect the health of the nation.
Accurate information is critical to political discourse, and everyone loses when so many pollsters are consistently wrong. Polls that repeatedly favor one side create false expectations that adversely influence the actions of both sides. The favored side becomes overconfident and suffers when the results on Election Day don’t meet expectations. And the disfavored side is disadvantaged in both fundraising and voter turnout by the appearance that the outcome is foreordained.
Sadly, Americans too often don’t get straight information from pollsters. When this is done knowingly or intentionally, it could be considered a form of voter suppression. For weeks this fall, Americans received a daily dispatch telling them that Donald Trump was facing a loss of near-historic proportions. At the same time, we were confidently assured that Democrats would take control of the Senate and add to their lead in the House. We were also assured that the pollsters had corrected their well-noted mistakes of 2016, when they predicted that Hillary Clinton would become the 45th president.
This time, we were promised that pollsters would get it right. They didn’t.
As pollsters face a potential existential crisis in the aftermath of this latest election, they should learn a valuable lesson. Their role should simply be to reflect reality as it stands by presenting an honest and candid view of the public’s attitudes toward the issues and the candidates. One could draw the conclusion that some pollsters present a picture of what they want the country to become rather than what it really is. Instead, they should strive to be unbiased reporters of the facts and not participants in the political contest. Nor should they be activists hoping to promote a new reality.
Further, the media that sponsor polls should demand better results because their reputations are on the line. It’s little wonder that many Americans—especially Republicans—voice complaints when newspapers and networks misinform them on the state of an election. What credibility can be given to news organizations that release a poll giving Joe Biden a 17-point lead in Wisconsin one week before Election Day? Being branded “rank propagandists,” as one knowledgeable observer recently called pollsters, cannot be good for business. 
It should not be unexpected in the aftermath of the election to hear complaints that something needs to be done about the horrible polling in this country. But finding solutions will be difficult. 
One could consider requiring reputable media outlets to avoid polling firms that do work for campaigns and others with political agendas. The apparent conflict of interest in such arrangements probably deserves correction. And there may be other ways to rein in erroneous polling. Congressional hearings shouldn’t be out of the question. But attempts to legislate and regulate polling would likely collide with First Amendment considerations, and so the options for regulation may be limited. 
As a result, the solution rests in the hands of those whose livelihoods depend on opinion polling. Pollsters and those who employ them need to take a serious look at the way polls are conducted. They need to re-examine how to collect a truly representative sample of voters, an admittedly difficult task in a world of new technology where landlines have mostly been replaced by cellphones and the internet. They also need to examine whether they are intentionally, knowingly or subconsciously letting their biases influence them.
During the five presidential campaigns I had the privilege of leading, we felt it was imperative that we receive accurate polling. A misread of a trend in one state or another could lead to a loss. So our campaigns demanded the best polling we could find and tried to make sure that it was free of bias so that we could rely on it when making our decisions.
All who use polling information, whether Democrats or Republicans, should do the same.

2020/11/10,Blacks and Latinos for Trump,Upward Mobility,https://www.wsj.com/articles/blacks-and-latinos-for-trump-11605048999,"Assuming the exit polls are more reliable than the ones that predicted a blue wave, Joe Biden did what he said he would do on Election Day in the upper Midwest—just not how he said he would do it.
In 2016, millions of people in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania who had supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 opted to back Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. It was these voters, not the Kremlin or Ku Klux Klan sympathizers, who delivered the White House to Republicans. Mr. Biden’s most compelling argument during the Democratic primary race was that he was far more likely than Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren to win back that voting bloc. It didn’t play out that way.
Mr. Biden flipped Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania not because he won over former Trump supporters but because he turned out Democrats who stayed home four years ago instead of voting for Mrs. Clinton. “Mr. Biden’s success was built on winning majorities of women, suburban voters and Black voters, according to the national AP VoteCast survey conducted Oct. 28 through Election Day evening,” The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. “Mr. Biden also ran up the score in cities such as Detroit and Milwaukee, where Democratic turnout had lagged four years ago.”
In Pennsylvania, large population centers like the Philadelphia suburbs made the difference, but it “wasn’t just eastern Pennsylvania that boosted Biden,” reported CNBC. “He improved upon Clinton’s margins in the blue counties of Dauphin, where the state capital of Harrisburg sits, and Centre County, which includes Penn State University.”
For liberals who are happy enough to be rid of Mr. Trump, this is a distinction without a difference. But for anyone playing the long game, it’s clear that the president’s brand of Republican populism isn’t going away. For some of us, the most interesting story of the 2020 election is not the Biden victory, which is the one thing that pollsters ultimately got right, but a Trump coalition that has not only endured but grown by more than seven million people in the past four years.

As intriguing is the increasing racial and ethnic diversity of that coalition. The president, who is regularly dismissed in the media as a bigot, saw a small uptick in his support among black and Hispanic voters. The black increase is notable but less impressive when put in context. Between 1976 and 2004, Republican presidential candidates averaged just over 11% of the black vote. John McCain won 4% in 2008 and Mitt Romney 6% in 2012, but they had to run against Barack Obama. In 2016, Mr. Trump, who didn’t have that excuse, managed only 8%, an improvement to be sure, but still below the pre-Obama norm. Mr. Trump’s 4-point increase this year gets him back to the GOP’s traditional share of the black vote.
The president’s performance among Latinos, which jumped to 32% from 28%, is more interesting. He was expected to do well with Florida’s Cuban-Americans, who have a long history of voting Republican, and he won about 55% of their votes. What stands out is his gains among other Latinos, both in Florida and elsewhere. In the Sunshine State, Latino support overall for the president grew by 12 points to 47%, and among Puerto Ricans, who generally lean much more heavily Democratic than Cubans, he won 30%.
Mr. Trump was likewise competitive among Hispanic voters of Mexican and Central American descent in places like Arizona, Nevada and South Texas. In 2016, Starr County, Texas, which abuts the border with Mexico, went for Mrs. Clinton by a 60-point margin. Mr. Biden won it this year by just 5 points. A Republican Party that can build on Mr. Trump’s gains among Hispanics in future elections will give the Democratic Party nightmares.
Black and Hispanic electorates are often grouped together by the media because both tend to be more liberal. Historically, however, they have had very different voting patterns. Blacks typically vote Democratic or stay home, as many did four years ago, while the Hispanic vote is far less one-sided and far likelier to swing. Recall that George W. Bush won more than 40% of Hispanics en route to his second term in 2004. And we’ll never know how much better Mr. Trump might have performed with Hispanics absent his harsh immigration rhetoric.
What these minority groups do have in common, however, is overrepresentation among those hurt economically by the Covid lockdowns. Before the pandemic, both groups were experiencing historically low poverty and unemployment, and their wages were rising. Perhaps Mr. Trump’s focus on reopening the economy and getting people back to work sooner rather than later is what resonated with them.

2020/11/10,Notable & Quotable: Police,Notable & Quotable,https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-police-11605048978,"From “Minneapolis to consider bringing in outside police officers amid shortage,” a report in the Star Tribune, Nov. 9:
Minneapolis officials are considering bringing in officers from other jurisdictions to help the city’s Police Department as they face a wave of violent crime and an officer shortage.
If the mayor and City Council approve the plan, officers from the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office and Metro Transit Police would temporarily work with the city, primarily helping to respond to violent 911 calls.
“We’re not gonna be having these people out taking bicycle theft reports. These are going to be people out combating crime issues,” said John Elder, a spokesman for Minneapolis police. . . . The proposal comes about five months after a majority of council members promised to work toward “ending” the Police Department following George Floyd’s death.
The city has struggled to combat a wave of violent crime, recording 74 homicides so far this year.
At the same time, an abnormally large number of officer departures following Floyd’s death and the subsequent unrest has strained the department’s resources. Some officers have filed PTSD claims.

2020/11/10,It’s Biden’s Virus Now,Business World,https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-bidens-virus-now-11605048847,"Joe Biden’s new coronavirus task force could usefully begin by reminding itself what was the invention or discovery, since 2009’s novel bird flu emergence, that made us think we could corral and suppress a new flu-like disease. Oh yes, now we remember: It was nothing. Nothing happened to suggest this was possible.
The panel could devote some attention to the media, which, having adopted the confirmed-case scoreboard, can’t stop touting this misleading statistic. Like reporting only field goals in football, it neither tells us the score nor provides us a reliable proxy for deducing the score.
On the “PBS NewsHour” last week, Brown University’s Dr. Ashish Jha estimated while we are identifying 100,000 new cases a day, “we’re probably missing 70%, 80% of all the cases out there.”
A top U.S. official in June estimated we are missing more than 90%.
The latest survey out of Germany, lauded for its testing, estimated it was missing 80% of cases. 
Crickets.
If you ever doubted the media clings mindlessly to its tropes, here’s proof.
If Americans knew they were being laughably misled, that the virus is far more widespread and their chances of encountering it are much greater than the confirmed case count (currently 10 million) implies, their behavior might be different. Especially we might get more mask-wearing by unwitting carriers to curb unwitting spread. Plus a vaccine works by inducing antibodies. In the first year, Pfizer might have enough to inoculate 25 million people at a time when, at current rates, 100 million of us may have antibodies. So having an accurate picture of prevalence will be necessary to make sure we aren’t wasting vaccine (never mind the already politicized question of who should get early doses: mobile young people to curtail the spread or older people and minorities because this is what the media clamors for). 
I told you in June our horse-race focus on case counts was about to become absurd. We’re there. This folly also contributes to our giant testing myopia. Mr. Biden now calls for a national testing board because it sounds take-chargey but let’s understand: Our current hunt for newly active infections is useful mainly for letting doctors know what disease they are treating when confronted with a severe case. It does nothing to control the spread. The results come too slowly and miss the overwhelming number of cases.
Don’t get me wrong: If a cheap, daily, at-home test were available, it would give us real leverage over the spread. We aren’t there yet and won’t be before a vaccine and natural effects have quashed the current destructive upsurge. Meanwhile, the neglected antibody testing will become more important so recipients of the new vaccines, which are likely to be only partly effective, know they are actually generating immunity and can resume normal life.

Mr. Biden, or any president, would have a tall job wrestling us toward a more realistic picture of the pandemic if he chose to do so at all. He would be up against things like the Washington Post headline, “Australia prevails over virus by putting its faith in science.” 
No, Australia took advantage of being an island in the South Pacific. U.S.-Canada border traffic is down 90% and still amounted to 170,988 people in a recent week. In El Paso alone, legal pedestrian traffic with Juárez continues at 200,000 a month. Across the U.S.-Mexico border as a whole, arrests are still running at 50,000 a month, a figure that is an unknown fraction of those who cross undetected. 
European nations likewise are not surrounded by water, with millions crossing national borders every day for work, shopping and family life. The Post story is a small but telling example of the reality principle gone AWOL. Reporters may not be able to fashion a realistic picture of what would be involved in trying to control the virus by controlling the border, but the officials who operate the border can. Even an enthusiast for border control like Donald Trump quickly discarded the idea as impractical.
When the records are plumbed, we will likely find that world leaders received the same advice: An easily transmitted, flu-like virus is not stoppable at a realistic cost in most geographies. We need to find non-magical ways to spare ourselves. The rational priorities were always: Protect the most vulnerable, drill the public on safety protocols, build up the hospitals to receive the wave, and push for a vaccine. That will be the Biden plan too.
On March 2, a World Health Organization official gushed that China’s draconian and dubiously documented response disproved a long-held belief that a flu-like disease can’t be contained. “Here we have a disease for which we have no vaccine, no treatment, we don’t fully understand. . . . We’ve remarkably seen that the virus is suppressed.” 
These famous last words were not helpful in our long, painful slog toward realism about the new coronavirus. Notably, the speaker, WHO’s Dr. Mike Ryan, would later turn to lauding Sweden’s approach to learning to live with Covid-19.
And yet an actual human miracle may be at hand: going from encountering a new virus to proving a vaccine in less than 12 months.

2020/11/10,The Justice Department and Politics,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-justice-department-and-politics-11605047090,"It certainly seems unlikely that President Donald Trump will end up winning a second term once all the votes are lawfully counted. But the current uncertainty is providing a useful reminder that media outlets have no role in the certification of election results. And as the Journal’s William McGurn notes, it’s hardly surprising that some voters are reluctant to accept a 2020 verdict from people who spent years promoting the idea that the 2016 results were illegitimate. 
Striking a note of what seems like extreme optimism Tuesday in response to a reporter’s question on assisting the Biden transition team, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.” 
So far there doesn’t seem to be enough evidence of fraud to change the outcome of the race, but if such evidence exists perhaps prosecutors will find it. Claudia Grisales of NPR reports:
Sounds reasonable enough, but as Ms. Grisales notes, at least some on the staff disagree:
It seems that Mr. Pilger will remain on the government payroll, where he’s been for a long time, and not without controversy. Readers may recall his name from another political issue, during the Obama administration.
In May of 2013 Stephen Olemacher of the Associated Press reported:
Ultimately Ms. Lerner wasn’t sorry enough to provide a full accounting to Congress. She decided to plead the Fifth instead of testifying. And she wasn’t much help finding thousands of lost emails detailing her work. 
It became clear over time that her work turned out to involve the Justice Department as well. In 2014 the Journal’s Devlin Barrett reported:
The targeted groups are known as 501(c)(4) organizations based on the relevant section of the Internal Revenue Code. A 2014 press release from Republicans on the House oversight committee stated:
Nothing warms the heart of a taxpayer like knowing her data will be shipped off to the Justice Department, shared with the FBI and added to a large database. 
Did Mr. Pilger have to wait this long to resign?
***
This column opined last week that it should be a time for humility among people in the media industry as we contemplate another year’s worth of flawed analysis and shattered expectations. Grading one’s own work can be tough, but many in the press corps should reckon with the fact that Donald Trump and limited government are much more popular than they wish to believe. 
At the time your humble correspondent did not realize that one prominent pillar of the media establishment would be assessing his own work on live television, though not exactly in a spirit of humble self-reflection.
In the New York Times Annie Karni and John Koblin report on MSNBC analyst Jon Meacham, who seems to have pulled one over on the network and its viewers:
News consumers can probably think of other words to describe this episode, but could there be a more fitting end to the last four years of national political media coverage?

2020/11/10,Libertarians and Realizing the Popular Will,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/libertarians-and-realizing-the-popular-will-11605043157,"Regarding Walter E. Block’s “Libertarians Spoil the Election” (op-ed, Nov. 9): The outcome of the 2020 election might have been different if states adopted ranked-choice voting. Libertarians could have ranked Jo Jorgensen as their first choice and President Trump as their second choice without fear of spoiling the election.
George Sakellos
Ringoes, N.J. 
Mr. Block makes a valid point regarding strategic voting—the influence of your vote depends on whether you are in a competitive state or district. Voting for a Democrat or a Republican is more a “wasted” vote in uncompetitive states than voting Libertarian, or for some other third party. 
At the same time, a vote is a market signal. Elections aren’t a one-shot deal. To reject President Trump was to send a signal—that steak is burned and I prefer medium-rare. That signal was stronger, by Mr. Block’s own reasoning, in competitive states. The GOP can continue to serve burned steak, and continue to lose market share and voters. 
Those who trust markets interpret them carefully. Also, they understand that a vote belongs to the voter and are loath to suggest that it belongs, for whatever reason, to a party. 
Martin D. Kennedy 
Nashville, Tenn.
Mr. Block’s assumption that the votes of Libertarians would automatically go to President Trump if forced into a bipartisan choice is both antidemocratic and false. He claims that there are only a few positions outside of economic views where Libertarians disagree with Democrats. But greens have known for years that Libertarians strongly agree with most of their views on “social” issues, for instance, the right to abortion, a most unpopular view with Republicans.
The fact is that more choice in an election brings out more voters. There is no guarantee that Libertarians would even bother to vote without their own candidate. Perhaps they would vote for the Green Party candidate instead.
Here’s who I blame: the Republican candidate himself. In 2000 Al Gore, a former senator from Tennessee, couldn’t win his home state and lost the election. President Trump’s recent behavior did more to scuttle his election chances than Libertarian votes in a few swing states.
David McCorquodale
Wilmington, Del.
Mr. Block’s self-flagellation misses an immediate directive to take. The energy consumed in self-indignation might be better focused in the Georgia Senate runoff: Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel won 114,575 votes, 2.3% on Nov. 3. Mr. Block: Republican Senate candidates would certainly love to call those votes their own.

2020/11/10,"ACLU, Girl Athletes and a Genetic Approach",Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/aclu-girl-athletes-and-a-genetic-approach-11605042984,"Regarding Sandra Bucha’s “The ACLU’s Betrayal of Athletic Girls” (op-ed, Nov. 7): We all understand why sports have been organized around biological sex—males on average are bigger, stronger and faster than females. Why should sports instead be organized around asserted gender identity? How does asserted gender identity impact size, strength and speed? If the ACLU wins and transgenderism continues to increase in popularity, eventually it will be fairly pointless for biological girls to participate in girls’ sports since most of the winners will be bigger, stronger and faster biological males.
James G. Russell
Midlothian, Va.
A solution may be for colleges and high schools to move away from the classification of “boys” and “girls” athletic events, drop sexual identity altogether and embrace a genetic DNA-based identity such as XX or XY classifications. Identity and surgically altered cosmetics then become moot. 
James K. Hamilton 
Independence, Ore.
As sports have evolved, there has always been a sense of fairness in the competition. This is most easily exemplified in boxing: No one wants to watch a match between a flyweight and a heavyweight, as it would simply be unfair. So, too, is a competition between a transgender male and a biological female. I remember the advent of Title IX in 1972 as a detraction from male sports, but we mostly all accepted it as a matter of equality and fairness. These days we are now faced with an almost impossible dilemma. With ever more gender identities being recognized (MFLGBTQI+) we are now running out of letters and into mathematical symbols.

2020/11/10,American Universities Aren’t Woke Enough,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-universities-arent-woke-enough-11605042917,"In “Woke Universities Lead America to a Primitive State” (op-ed, Nov. 3), Prof. John M. Ellis paints a picture of American higher education that is difficult to recognize. I was president of Adelphi University and Ramapo College of New Jersey for 15 years each, one public and one private, and a leader of two state coordinating boards. He describes college campuses as places where “people nationwide have been physically assaulted” for their beliefs. Where? How often? I have never heard of a campus president or faculty member who shouted, “lock her up” because he or she disagreed with an idea. He claims that “radical-left faculty have established a political orthodoxy” without evidence and ignoring the orthodoxy reinforced by certain media outlets and a notorious Twitter feed.
Furthermore, he criticizes the civic education received by young people without acknowledging the underfunding of public schools, the maligning of public-school teachers and the diminution of civic education by local school boards in response to federal policy. One consequence of these actions is that people in the U.S. seem to think that our political philosophy is capitalism instead of democracy.
However, Prof. Ellis is correct when he asserts that the authority of power-hungry radicals depends on social division, something promoted by the occupant of the White House.

2020/11/10,"Three Cheers, or Two, for Florida’s Elections",Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/three-cheers-or-two-for-floridas-elections-11605042807,"Gov. Jeb Bush (“How Florida Became America’s Vote-Counting Model,” Cross Country, Nov. 7) is right. My wife and I have worked the five previous election cycles in two different Florida counties (Pasco, Pinellas) and from the inside we know how well the Florida election system works. Within three days of dropping off our mail-in ballots at the Collier County election office, we were able to see confirmation that our ballots had been received and counted on the election website. Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania would be well advised to check out Florida’s system.
Lance Horn

One has to wonder if Gov. Bush thinks any of the states which can’t count the vote on time really want improvement. The present, uh, er, imprecise system is working fine for the Democrats.
Jack Lacey 
Southold, N.Y.
I found out recently that Duval County in Florida has no way for a voter to verify that his or her vote was tallied properly. Many counties in Florida don’t allow you to check your vote. How are we supposed to believe in the integrity of our voting system if we cannot double check our vote? Can someone with fancy software hack the system and change my vote? I think this needs to be addressed.

2020/11/11,Georgia’s Reassuring Vote Recount,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/georgias-reassuring-vote-recount-11605136330,"Despite all the political fury, America’s ballot-counting procedures continue to move ahead as intended. In Georgia, where Joe Biden is leading by about 14,000 votes out of five million cast, officials Tuesday began preparing to audit every ballot by hand.
“We’ll be counting every single piece of paper, every single ballot, every single lawfully cast, legal ballot,” said Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. “People will be working lots of overtime in the next coming week.” Some type of recount is prudent whenever there’s a slim margin like this one, 0.28 percentage point, even if it weren’t a presidential race.
Raising the stakes further is that Georgia is set to hold two Senate runoff elections in January, which will decide which party controls the upper chamber. Senate control will determine the national policy direction for the next two years. Georgia should be assured, going into that political maelstrom, that its new election systems are functioning as designed.
Doing a full audit by hand is more than Georgia law requires. It’s unlikely to swing the state into Donald Trump’s column, since overcoming his 14,000-vote deficit would require the discovery of serious errors that have so far escaped detection. In any case, Mr. Biden would still have the required 270 Electoral College votes, unless his even-larger margins in Pennsylvania or other states were also somehow overturned.
Mr. Raffensperger, a Republican, emphasized that his office is ready to look into every allegation of voting shenanigans. “If you have any information about illegal voting or voter fraud, bring that to our attention,” he said. “We will investigate every case that we hear.” If Georgia’s painstaking recount doesn’t substantiate claims of major fraud, Americans will be more confident the election was conducted fairly.
The recount also might ease concerns about Georgia’s new voting machines. The system, which made its statewide debut this year, allows voters to make their choices on a touch-screen. Then a printer spits out a ballot with a summary that shows, in writing, the candidates selected, so the voter can review them. The same information is translated and printed in a two-dimensional bar code that scanners can read.
When the state picked this system, advocates of hand-marked ballots objected. They argued in a lawsuit that the text summary would give voters no way to “visually review and confirm whether the bar code accurately conveys their intended selections.” It sounds like a plot from a bad thriller movie: ballots coming out of a printer that say they’re for one candidate, while sneaking another candidate into the bar code?
As one reassurance, officials typically choose a statistical sample of paper ballots to audit by hand. In this case, Mr. Raffensperger has chosen to audit the entire presidential count. “With the margin being so close, it will require a full, by hand recount in each county,” he explained. “This will help build confidence. It will be an audit, a recount and a recanvass all at once.”
There’s no reason not to let the process play out. The odds seem small that the preliminary vote tallies will be overturned in enough states to give Mr. Trump a second term in the White House. But if the law allows him to ask for recounts in states where he trails only narrowly, then doing so is his prerogative. Georgia’s intent is to have a final result ready to certify on Nov. 20, as originally scheduled. Keep calm and count on.

2020/11/11,Democracy Dies in the Open,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/democracy-dies-in-the-open-11605136283,"Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” form of government autonomy died this summer, and the Chinese Communist Party is now moving fast to crush its remnants. Beijing’s latest target is the Legislative Council and its pro-democracy lawmakers.
On Wednesday China’s legislature passed a resolution allowing Hong Kong authorities to remove lawmakers without judicial oversight. Hong Kong authorities quickly booted four pro-democracy legislators, including Dennis Kwok and Alvin Yeung, two brave defenders of an independent judiciary. 
Hong Kong’s remaining pro-democracy lawmakers responded by resigning en masse. “Sooner or later we would all have been disqualified,” Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai said. Unconditional allegiance to Beijing is now a requirement for office. At a news conference Wednesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said it is disqualifying for lawmakers to oppose the new national security law or to plan on “indiscriminately voting down” Beijing’s legislative agenda. Ms. Lam will go down in history for betraying her city.
The Communist Party long ago rigged LegCo, as the legislature is known, so democrats could never gain a majority. Pro-democracy lawmakers have nonetheless served their constituents by working to prevent or delay some of the worst legislation and appointees. This new resolution completes LegCo’s transformation into a rubber-stamp body. It represents “Beijing’s rule by decree in its ultimate form,” said Claudia Mo, one of the lawmakers who resigned in protest.
Even before this resolution, Hong Kong’s opposition was under siege. Last week Hong Kong police arrested eight current and former pro-democracy lawmakers. They face up to a year in prison for disruptive behavior at a LegCo meeting last spring, but their real offense was defending the rights of Hong Kongers. 
The scuffle in May broke out as pro-Beijing lawmakers worked to ram through legislation that suppresses speech by outlawing disrespect of the Chinese national anthem. Pro-Beijing legislators who participated in the tussle haven’t been charged, but pro-democracy lawmaker Andrew Wan, who had to be carried off on a stretcher by paramedics after the scrap, was among those arrested. 
Despite widespread opposition, the national-anthem bill passed on June 4. Less than a month later, Beijing imposed a sweeping national-security law on Hong Kong that effectively prohibits all dissent. Fearing that pro-democracy candidates would gain seats despite the rigged system, the government postponed the LegCo elections scheduled for last September. Now they’ll be meaningless.
Freedom dying anywhere diminishes the world, but Hong Kong’s fate is especially important because it shows China can’t be trusted to keep its international promises. Its treaty with the U.K. promised autonomy to Hong Kong for 50 years through 2047. It was extinguished in 2020.

2020/11/11,California’s Progressive Thumping,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/californias-progressive-thumping-11605136309,"Democrats and unions in California are shell-shocked. Voters last Tuesday rejected a referendum that would have allowed racial preferences in state hiring and college admissions, defeated a massive business property tax hike, and rescued tens of thousands of gig economy jobs. What is this, Texas? 
Unions and their Democratic allies, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, shelled out nearly $60 million for a referendum (Prop. 15) that would have eliminated a key restraint on state spending. California’s 1978 Prop. 13 caps taxes on commercial and residential property at 1% of their assessed value (i.e., purchase price) and limits annual increases to 2%.
Prop. 13 is the only emollient in California’s oppressive business climate, and public unions have long wanted to abolish it. They hoped to chip away at it this year with Prop. 15, which would have required that commercial property be reassessed at market value at least every three years. The initiative was forecast to raise property taxes by $8 billion to $12.5 billion a year by 2025.
Unions declared the tax hike was needed to support education and public safety (even as progressives pushed cuts to law enforcement) and to make big corporations pay their “fair share.” Yet farmers, manufacturers and small businesses warned they’d be whacked too. Voters believed businesses, not the unions. On Tuesday the Associated Press finally announced that Prop. 15 failed, 51.8% to 48.2%. Most non-coastal counties rejected the referendum by 20 or more points. 
Voters also approved Prop. 22 (58.5% to 41.5%), which was strongly opposed by unions and plaintiff attorneys. Prop. 22 exempted gig workers like Uber drivers, Instacart shoppers and Grubhub takeout food deliverers from the state’s union-backed AB5 law, which reclassified hundreds of thousands of independent contractors as employees. Unions claimed Prop. 22 would let businesses like Uber skirt workplace protections and pay workers starvation wages.
Yet the referendum also required companies to provide workers health-insurance subsidies as well as occupational accident coverage and to pay 120% of the local minimum wage. Gig companies warned AB5 would lead to fewer jobs and rides as well as higher prices. These concerns were echoed by Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which endorsed Prop. 22.
In other good ballot news, voters rejected an initiative that would have allowed local governments to expand rent control (59.7% to 40.3%). San Francisco was the only county to support the measure, though rents there have plummeted as tech workers have fled amid the pandemic. Homelessness, crime and open-air drug use, rampant in the city, aren’t incentives for them to return. 
San Francisco also approved a slew of tax hikes, including a doubling of the real-estate transfer tax on high-end homes and a surtax on CEO “excess compensation,” which will drive out more people and businesses. California’s one-party political rule will be hard to break, but at least voters outside of San Fran have issued important checks on union and progressive governance.

2020/11/11,The Nord Stream Finish Line,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-nord-stream-finish-line-11605136254,"President Trump’s term began with claims that he would do Russia’s bidding. It could end with his Administration delivering a decisive blow against one of Vladimir Putin’s key strategic objectives—unless Congress gets in the way.
We’re referring to Nord Stream 2, the $11 billion gas pipeline that passes from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea. The Trump Administration has opposed the pipeline as it tries to limit Russian influence over U.S. allies. Last month the State Department tightened sanctions in a bid to freeze it altogether. 
The House and Senate passed legislation over the summer that would codify this approach. The language is included in the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual defense policy bill which must be finalized in the coming weeks. But we’re hearing murmurs that some Members may have second thoughts. It’s not yet guaranteed the toughened sanctions will make it into the final bill after a conference committee reconciles the two versions.
Moscow hopes that under a Biden Administration it can restart construction of Nord Stream 2. It has invested in the pipeline because it would dramatically increase Western Europe’s reliance on Russian gas. It would also further Moscow’s objective of isolating Eastern European states like Ukraine and Poland by cutting them out of existing energy-distribution channels.
The Trump Administration, with Congress’s support, has slowed the project. The Swiss pipe-laying firm Allseas stopped construction late last year with about 100 miles remaining. If the National Defense Authorization Act locks in U.S. sanctions against firms involved in insuring and financing the project, it might no longer be viable at all.
Yet some in the foreign-policy establishment want to relax the pressure for fear of upsetting the U.S.-German relationship. It’s true that Mr. Trump has sometimes needlessly needled the Germans—we strongly opposed his U.S. troop withdrawal earlier this year.
But energy politics is an area where the U.S. has rightly demanded reciprocity from Berlin. German dependence on Russian gas weakens the NATO alliance. Yet Berlin has refused to reconsider Nord Stream even after the poisonings of Sergei Skripal and Alexei Navalny. During the Trump Administration some liberals proclaimed German Chancellor Angela Merkel the “leader of the free world,” but German Nord Stream politics is mercantilist, not moral.
The incoming Democratic Administration wants closer cooperation with Western Europe. That shouldn’t come at the cost of increasing NATO vulnerability to Russia. Congress would assist U.S. and European strategic interests if it gets the Nord Stream sanctions over the finish line in the lame duck session.

2020/11/11,This Election Result Won’t Be Overturned,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-election-result-wont-be-overturned-11605134335,"It has been an eventful, unsettling year: A deadly virus struck without warning and claimed almost a quarter-million American lives; a lockdown demolished personal routines and left us gasping for normality; a sudden, deep recession snatched newfound prosperity from many families; and now a rocketlike recovery lifts up some but leaves many on the launchpad. So why not finish out 2020 with a misforecast election as the finale? 
Pundits predicted a blue tsunami of historic proportions that would carry Democrats into the White House, flip the U.S. Senate, increase Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s caucus by as many as 20 seats, and transform a basketful of red-state legislatures into blue ones just in time for redistricting in 2021. Well, the White House changed hands. But none of the rest happened.
The final RealClearPolitics average of polls predicted Joe Biden would win the popular vote by 7.2 percentage points. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com put Mr. Biden’s likely margin at 8 points. The Cook Political Report had it at “more like 9 or 10 points.” As of Wednesday, with some ballots yet to be counted in California and New York, President Trump trailed Mr. Biden by 3.3 points.
Voter turnout was up. Once everything is counted, the turnout rate will likely reach 66.5%, the highest since 1908’s barnburner between William Howard Taft and William Jennings Bryan. But the nature of this enthusiasm differed by party. The Fox News Voter Analysis found 51% of Biden supporters voted more against Mr. Trump than for the Democratic candidate, while 79% of Mr. Trump’s backers voted more for him than against Mr. Biden.
Mr. Trump also won 26% of nonwhite voters, according to NBC’s exit poll, driving commentators on the left crazy. One described these voters as “distracted.” A New York Times columnist found it “personally devastating” that many blacks and gays voted for the president. Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) warned that black male Trump voters “have a price to pay for years to come.” This is what passes for liberal tolerance.
Still, enough voters wanted change. Mr. Biden maneuvered successfully to make the election a referendum on the president’s personality and his handling of Covid. For months Mr. Trump was content to fight on that turf, trying only fitfully to contrast his agenda with his challenger’s.
Presidents win re-election only in part by heralding their achievements and outlining second-term agendas; much more depends on contrasting their opponent’s values and views with their own. That Mr. Biden’s margin of victory was much slimmer than projected can be credited partly to Mr. Trump’s emphasis in the closing days on their substantive differences—discussing fracking in Pennsylvania and toleration of socialism in Miami. But it wasn’t enough.
Mr. Trump is now pursuing legal challenges in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, and there will be an automatic recount in Georgia, given Mr. Biden’s 0.29-point lead there. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is correct that Mr. Trump is “100% within his rights” to go to court over concerns about fraud and transparency. But the president’s efforts are unlikely to move a single state from Mr. Biden’s column, and certainly they’re not enough to change the final outcome.
There are only three statewide contests in the past half-century in which recounts changed the outcome: the 1974 New Hampshire Senate race, the 2004 Washington governor’s contest, and the 2008 Minnesota Senate election. The candidates in these races were separated, respectively, by 355, 261 and 215 votes after Election Day. 
These margins aren’t much like today’s. Mr. Biden led Wednesday in Wisconsin by 20,540 votes, Pennsylvania by 49,064, Michigan by 146,123, Arizona by 12,614, Nevada by 36,870 and Georgia by 14,108.
To win, Mr. Trump must prove systemic fraud, with illegal votes in the tens of thousands. There is no evidence of that so far. Unless some emerges quickly, the president’s chances in court will decline precipitously when states start certifying results, as Georgia will on Nov. 20, followed by Pennsylvania and Michigan on Nov. 23, Arizona on Nov. 30, and Wisconsin and Nevada on Dec. 1. By seating one candidate’s electors, these certifications will raise the legal bar to overturn state results and make it even more difficult for Mr. Trump to prevail before the Electoral College meets Dec. 14.
TV networks showed jubilant crowds in major cities celebrating Mr. Biden’s victory; they didn’t show the nearly equal number of people who mourned Mr. Trump’s defeat. U.S. politics remains polarized and venomous. Closing out this election will be a hard but necessary step toward restoring some unity and political equilibrium. Once his days in court are over, the president should do his part to unite the country by leading a peaceful transition and letting grievances go.

2020/11/11,How Trump or Biden Can Get Serious About Human Rights in Cuba,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-trump-or-biden-can-get-serious-about-human-rights-in-cuba-11605134209,"As an insular nation with a population smaller than Ohio’s, Cuba plays an outsize role in both world affairs and U.S. domestic policy. Either President Trump, who won Florida, or Joe Biden, who’d have liked to, should take stock of the Cuban regime’s actions—among them gross violations of human rights, efforts to destabilize the Western Hemisphere, and broad collaboration with China, Iran, North Korea and Russia. The U.S. needs a bold new approach, using corruption-focused sanctions against Cuban officials and their accomplices.
One of the most reprehensible aspects of Cuban statecraft has been its trafficking every year of some 50,000 medical doctors, who are effectively enslaved and forced to work in other countries. “The Cuban regime takes up to 90% of what they charge . . . other countries for each doctor, pocketing considerable revenues and exploiting the doctors, who receive but a pittance,” Michael Kozak, the acting assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said in an April briefing. Cuban government 2018 figures indicate slave labor brings in $7 billion a year and that it is the regime’s single largest source of revenue, accounting for 60% of its total foreign income. 
Past U.S. administrations have pursued various policies toward Cuba, ranging from the decades-long economic embargo and restrictions on travel to a “normalization” policy under President Obama. Mr. Trump rolled back the Obama administration’s policy and reimposed comprehensive sanctions—but more needs to be done. 
The U.S. should target Havana’s most heinous policies and do so in a way that would be difficult for its allies and supporters to counteract. The key to the new strategy is the Global Magnitsky Act of 2016, known informally as GloMag. It authorizes sanctions to cut off Cuban officials and their accomplices from global financial services, augmenting traditional sanctions that have cut them off from the U.S. financial industry. 
The 2012 Magnitsky Act targeted individual Russian officials involved in the killing of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in prison in 2009. The GloMag expanded that regime to cover foreign government officials implicated in human-rights abuses and corruption anywhere in the world. 
President Trump further expanded the GloMag program in 2017, through Executive Order 13818, which broadens the scope of conduct that can trigger sanctions from “gross violations of internationally recognized human rights” to “serious human rights abuse,” and replaces “significant acts of corruption” with the broader term “corruption.” Since the law’s passage, the U.S. has imposed GloMag sanctions on individuals and entities from more than 20 countries, most recently designating for corruption Gibran Bassil, a senior Lebanese official. Still, these designations came in a trickle, rather than a wave.
Sanctions—including asset freezes, travel bans and exclusion from financial services—should be imposed on Cuban government officials involved in a variety of acts, all of which inevitably involve corruption, such as human trafficking, violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea, and drug trafficking. Sanctions should also target their agents or associates, whether or not they work for the government. There is sufficient available evidence that the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control could quickly make GloMag designations and rapidly adjust them as the targets attempt to circumvent sanctions. These designations could also be made even more expeditiously by a presidential executive order.
If adroitly deployed on a large scale, GloMag sanctions would cut deeply into Havana’s revenues and impair the ability of virtually all Cuban officials and their allies to do business or even travel. GloMag and other legal tools also allow the U.S. to reach third parties, who have financial or other dealings with targeted Cuban officials. Those parties could be subjected either to sanctions or criminal prosecution. The availability of these legal tools would reduce support for the Cuban regime world-wide. 
Because European Union governments and other U.S. allies have vigorously embraced anticorruption policies, they would find it difficult to oppose this strategy. Canada, Britain and several other Western countries have GloMag-like sanction statutes of their own. 
Domestically, a strong stand against the modern slave trade that underpins Havana’s statecraft should draw bipartisan support. Internationally, given Britain’s indispensable role in eradicating the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the 19th Century, London should be a U.S. partner in cracking down on Cuba-driven slave trade and corruption. By strategically employing GloMag, the U.S. can curtail Cuba’s malign activities and push the Cuban regime toward major reforms.

2020/11/11,Want a Coup? Abolish the Electoral College,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/want-a-coup-abolish-the-electoral-college-11605134162,"Imagine a future presidential election in which the incumbent refuses to concede and enlists the full power of the federal government to overturn the apparent democratic outcome.
Now imagine that the election in question is actually run by a federal agency or by some nationwide quasigovernmental authority charged with collecting and aggregating the results from all 50 states. 
I don’t know about you, but I might worry a bit about the pressure that could be brought to bear on that single authority. I might worry a bit about the objectivity of the attorney general and the federal election commissioners who would be in a position to ramp up that pressure.
I might even cast a sober look at what tends to happen in other countries where leaders are chosen in elections conducted by the national government—countries like Russia, where two years ago Vladimir Putin claimed 77% of the vote. 
I might also be tempted to meditate on the general perils of centralizing power, and the specific perils of centralizing the power to decide who will yield power. 
By then, I might be so worked up that I’ll manage to forget why the Electoral College is a threat to democracy, and how its abolition—and the nationalization of presidential elections—would help make democracy function more smoothly. 
But I’ll know who to ask for a refresher. By and large, it seems like the people who are most in a dither about the current president’s attempt to retain power are the same people who think we ought to make it easier for the next president who wants to do the same thing. I’m sure they can explain that to me.

2020/11/11,Joe Biden’s Florida Nightmare,Wonder Land,https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-bidens-florida-nightmare-11605134036,"The U.S. is in postelection hell today because of what happened in Florida 20 years ago. Joe Biden remembers that 2000 presidential-election nightmare. Well, it has come back to haunt him as he treads water waiting for Donald Trump to concede. 
It doesn’t matter if you were 5 years old in 2000. If this past week you were dancing in the streets to celebrate Democratic war horse Joe Biden’s nominal defeat of Donald Trump, not least among the reasons is payback for what happened in Florida, today known simply as Bush v. Gore. 
The inconsolable political bitterness today between Republicans and Democrats began in Florida’s recount struggle at the end of the 2000 presidential election. The Democratic nominee was Al Gore, Bill Clinton’s stolid vice president. The Republican candidate was Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
Former President Bush is widely admired today. Not then. It is impossible to overstate the derision Democrats and the media dumped on Gov. Bush, seeing him as an unworthy, cartoonlike character who had stumbled into his party’s nomination. History really does repeat itself.
Any website can provide the details of this high Florida melodrama, in which the election came down to one state and two candidates separated by fewer than 600 votes, not tens of thousands in multiple states as now. After weeks of litigation over counting Florida’s now-infamous hanging-chad ballots, the Supreme Court put the country out of its recount pain by voting 5-4 in favor of a result that gave Gov. Bush Florida’s electors and victory. 
To this day, Democrats have never gotten over Bush v. Gore, an election they believe they only lost in the Supreme Court. That, not Donald Trump, is the real origin of their “resistance” to everything and everyone in the Republican Party. 
Democrats hated George Bush and his presidency. They lampooned him mercilessly. When in 2004 he defeated Sen. John Kerry, they were apoplectic. You’d have thought Alfred E. Neuman had been elected. I recall one newspaper article describing how some distraught New Yorkers wanted to create missionary-like groups to visit voters in the heartland—the people who in 2016 became the infidel deplorables. 
Some in retrospect regard the 2008 election of Barack Obama as restoring a degree of political normalcy, but that is false. 

The U.S.’s experience with hyperpartisanship began in George W. Bush’s presidency and widened in the Obama years. The phenomenon of rampant political polarization became an object of fascination at Pew Research, which produced a chart showing that between 1987 and 2012 the intensity of the nation’s differences were relatively flat by most measures—except party affiliation—which was, and remains, off the charts.
That standoff brought us to a grim endpoint—the past four years as a nonstop exercise in simply shutting down the U.S. political system until the 2020 election came around. After all this, it is beyond fatuous (and insincere) for Democrats and the media to demand that Trump voters graciously give up. Or for Mr. Biden to limply dismiss the Trumpian intransigence as “an embarrassment.”
Would a traditional transfer of power be good for the country? Uh-huh. But Democrats made this unruly political bed, and now the American system is going to have to lie in it while every Trump challenge, lawsuit, dead voter and unsigned ballot is pushed across Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan until this election runs out of gas and ends. 
Hard as it is for some to realize today, it took two decades of political animosity—which Mr. Obama actively exploited on the issues of wealth and race—to produce the ultimate anti-politician, Donald J. Trump. 
I only partly buy the now-conventional wisdom that Mr. Trump rose because he identified heretofore unrecognized populist impulses in blue-collar Americans. Before his victory over Hillary Clinton, he stood on the presidential-primary stage with accomplished Republican politicians and convinced a big slice of an electorate in the grip of wheel-spinning polarization to take a last-gasp flyer on the former host of “The Apprentice.” Then, Donald Trump did win the 2016 election. 
When this is over in several weeks, someone should give Mr. Trump a framed, gold-plated master recording of Frank Sinatra singing, “I did it my way.” To put that differently: Any close-to-normal first-term president running on Mr. Trump’s record—including the fast-track anti-Covid vaccine protocols—should have won the election with more than 300 electoral votes. 
If you sort through the entrails of the Edison Research exit poll, the only consistent variable is that voter approval of Mr. Trump hovers around 45%, no matter how the question is asked. From Day One, his presidential approval has never touched 50%, while every president since FDR has gone over 60% at least once. 
Donald Trump didn’t care, obviously. A gambler to the end, he went all in for the umpteenth time on having an ace in the hole to play in his poker match with Joe Biden. No question, it’s always great when you pull that off.

2020/11/11,Covid: Not Learning That Much From States,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-not-learning-that-much-from-states-11605126377,"Scott Gottlieb points out actions taken by various states and posits there are lessons to be learned from these and other states in their attempts to control Covid-19 (“The States Are Laboratories for Covid Control,” op-ed, Nov. 9).
I am struggling to see what lessons are being learned. For example, in the beginning of the pandemic we were advised that wearing masks may be a psychological way to feel protected but that they were useless and possibly harmful from an infectious-disease standpoint. Now the big three actions that must be taken to beat the virus are: Wear a proper mask, keep socially distant and wash your hands.
If testing and contact tracing are beneficial, when will we see the reports showing the success of this massive effort? How do we know closing bars and restaurants but not stopping protests and riots, or closing churches but not casinos is working? It seems improvements in medical care and therapeutics over the course of the pandemic have achieved amazing results such that reported survival rates for those infected under age 69 are 99%-plus and those over 70 are 94%. With that recovery level why would we impose draconian economic, physical and psychological hardship on the general population when we could focus on those in the 1% and 6% populations to help keep them safe until the vaccines arrive?
According to reports, infections are surging all over the world in another wave that seems to defy all controls, similar to the 1918-19 influenza pandemic.

You don’t need a Ph.D. or M.D. to understand that while this virus can spread among those under the age of 18, school closures for eight months have caused more damage than the deleterious effects of the disease on children. Dr. Gottlieb is part of an advisory group to Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, so I would hope he points out that in a state with much more ICU capacity per capita than France, where French children are currently attending in-person learning, it is time to put the health and development of our youth before most other measures in this long and protracted fight. Gov. Baker should have more support from physicians like Dr. Gottlieb as he pushes to re-open school to in-person learning.

2020/11/11,President Trump Hasn’t Turned Arizona Blue,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/president-trump-hasnt-turned-arizona-blue-11605126335,"In “Has Trump Turned Arizona Blue?” (op-ed, Nov. 5), Masada Siegel basks in the belief that “suburban” (i.e., white) folks drive elections, in this case, white women. She offers a quaint picture of upscale greenbelt harmony and suggests that a “common-sense approach” to problem solving is a quality unique to suburban Arizonans.
However, she ignores, or perhaps simply doesn’t perceive, the rising and very real driver of election outcomes here: Latino Arizona, which is now 31% of the state’s population. Throughout the nation, this diverse group is understudied, underreported and profoundly misunderstood. 
Paul Guidera
Paradise Valley, Ariz.
President Trump did not turn Arizona blue. John McCain lost much of his support because of his voting record over his last two years. I don’t believe Mormon women vote any differently than Episcopalian or Baptist women.
What has changed Arizona’s voting pattern is an influx of Californians who have become tired of high taxes, high home prices and chaotic social policies. Unfortunately, when they arrive in Arizona (and in Idaho and Texas and . . . ), they vote for the same stupid politicians and policies that caused the conditions that led them to leave California. That is not President Trump’s fault.

2020/11/11,Responding to Sen. Lieberman on 2000 and 2020,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/letters-responding-to-sen-lieberman-on-2000-and-2020-11605126277,"In “A Disputed Election: My Lesson From 2000” (op-ed, Nov. 5), conveniently left unsaid by Sen. Joe Lieberman is that the Supreme Court got it right. 
After the 2000 election the very liberal Washington Post led a consortium of newspapers, including the Journal, which spent months examining contested ballots cast in Florida. They categorized them in every possible way. Hanging chads, partially punched chads, even ballots that only had a dimple. This consortium found that virtually any way you tabulated the ballots, George W. Bush won. 
While I often hear liberal media members and Democratic operatives and politicians say with disdain that the Supreme Court put George Bush in the White House, the facts show he won the election fair and square.
Dave Palmer
Rockville, Md.
Mr. Lieberman cites the civil 2000 post-election conduct by the Democratic Party, but says nothing about its performance after the 2016 election. Democrats immediately started screaming for impeachment even before the inauguration, waging a take-no-prisoners war on this administration unmatched in American history, staging a manufactured and costly impeachment trial and blaming President Trump for every misfortune that has befallen this country, even the virus pandemic treatment, which he attacked very aggressively.
Perhaps worst of all has been the Democratic Party standing by silently during the massive riots and destruction in our cities, undermining the rule of law and order in this otherwise peaceful country. It is hard to put this genie back in the bottle.

The important point is that, unfortunately, there is a trade-off between personal freedom/economic growth and the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. Most politicians, especially Democrats, play down that trade-off, while others claim that the only goal worth pursuing is minimization of the rate of Covid cases and deaths. Ms. Clayton claims that government’s business isn’t making people happy, but making them safe. But I don’t think most of us want to live in a country where everyone is safe, but almost no one is happy. Didn’t Thomas Jefferson make that point long ago in the Declaration of Independence?

2020/11/11,Taxes for Transportation Were Well Received,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/taxes-for-transportation-were-well-received-11605126237,"Counter to Grover Norquist’s “Voters (Mostly) Reject Tax Hikes” (op-ed, Nov. 9), voters eager for better public transit approved 15 of 18 ballot-measure tax increases on Nov. 3. Adding these to the 32 measures approved earlier this year brings the success rate of transit ballot initiatives in 2020 to a high of 92%. In Austin, Texas, voters approved investing $7.1 billion in three new rail lines, a downtown transit tunnel and bus-service expansion, including an all-electric fleet. The San Francisco-San Jose rail line, Caltrain, gained dedicated funding estimated at $108 million annually for the next 30 years thanks to voter approval of a 1/8-cent sales tax in the three counties that the line serves. Seattle voters renewed a sales tax to fund transit projects for an additional six years and increased the tax from 0.1% to 0.15%. In Missoula, Mont., voters approved a mill levy request that will raise $3 million annually to increase bus frequency on popular routes, expand weekend service, and move closer to an all-electric bus fleet. These election results weren’t even squeakers; support ranged from 59% in Missoula to 67% in Austin, 70% in the Bay Area and 81% in Seattle.

2020/11/12,Will Biden Say Howdy Modi?,East is East,https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-biden-say-howdy-modi-11605224797,"Should the Hindu nationalists running India fear a Biden presidency? Probably less than the most ardent fans and foes of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party appear to believe, but likely more than the most sanguine observers hope. As human rights and democracy return to the heart of U.S. foreign policy, their decline in India will almost certainly no longer go unnoticed in the White House.
Since Mr. Biden’s election, much of the debate in India has centered on Prime Minister Narendra Modi allegedly overplaying his hand by embracing Donald Trump too tightly. At a campaign-style rally before 50,000 Indian-Americans in Houston last year, Mr. Modi all but endorsed the president’s re-election with the words “Ab ki baar, Trump Sarkar”—“This time, a Trump government.” The prime minister also hailed Mr. Trump’s resolve “to make America great again.” The Trump campaign later used Mr. Modi’s praise in an ad aimed at Indian-American voters.
At one level, Mr. Modi’s public courtship of Mr. Trump is easily explained. Like many world leaders, the Indian prime minister was merely trying to build a relationship with the world’s most powerful man.
But the Modi-Trump bromance also symbolized the awkward tango between Hindu nationalists and American populists. In a tweet last year, quickly deleted after an uproar, the then Indian ambassador in Washington posed for a photograph with Steve Bannon, and hailed him as a “‘Dharma’ warrior” who reads the Bhagavad Gita. Pro-BJP news channels in India have interviewed the likes of Mr. Bannon and former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka. In February, B.L. Santhosh, a senior figure in the BJP, responded to a Bernie Sanders tweet about anti-Muslim mob violence in India by threatening that “you compel us to play a role in Presidential elections.” (Mr. Santhosh later deleted his tweet.) 
Mr. Biden, in contrast, has not flirted with Hindu nationalism, and his policy documents reflect that. The Indian media has gone after the Democrat for his campaign website’s negative comments on a recent Indian law that pointedly excludes Muslims from the right to fast-track citizenship for refugees from three Muslim-majority neighboring countries. Human-rights activists say the law undermines India’s constitutional commitment to secularism. They also fear that, combined with a proposed population register to list all citizens, the Modi government will use the law to disenfranchise India’s 200 million-strong Muslim minority. The government denies this charge, and has temporarily shelved plans for the register.
Mr. Biden’s website also expresses concerns about rights violations in the Muslim-majority region of Jammu and Kashmir. And at a campaign event during the Democratic primaries last year, Kamala Harris declared that the Kashmiris “are not alone” and that “we are all watching” the situation in Kashmir. Ms. Harris also supported her fellow Indian-American Democrat, Rep. Pramila Jayapal —a critic of the Modi government’s policies in Kashmir—in a spat with the Indian foreign minister.

What does all this portend for U.S.-India ties on Mr. Biden’s watch? On social media, prominent commentators on the Hindu right fulminate about “jihadi dems” and the “hate India Leftist-Islamist nexus.” These fears are overblown. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as vice president, Mr. Biden has long championed stronger U.S.-India ties. His advisers are experienced hands aware that bilateral relations are too deep-rooted and multifaceted to be derailed by Twitter spats or a little diplomatic gaucherie. The rise of China as America’s top geopolitical rival and the importance of climate change to Democrats naturally elevate India’s significance in Washington.
At the same time, Indians would be foolish to expect the free pass on human rights and democracy issued by the Trump administration to remain valid. By passing controversial legislation like the citizenship law, elevating hard-line antiminority figures within the BJP, cracking down on peaceful dissent with heavy-handed antiterrorism laws, and launching a Putinesque assault on civil-society groups, Mr. Modi has only himself to blame for fears that he represents a threat to liberal democracy.
As recently as 2015, President Barack Obama praised Mr. Modi as “India’s reformer-in-chief” in Time magazine. These days the prime minister is more likely to be mentioned in the global media in the same breath as demagogues like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In a phone interview, Larry Diamond, an expert on global democracy at the Hoover Institution, includes Mr. Modi in a shortlist of world leaders who “are eviscerating democracies from within.”
Sweden’s V-Dem Institute warns that India is “on the verge of losing its status as a democracy due to the severe shrinking of space for the media, civil society, and the opposition.” Freedom House still lists India as a “free” country, but in this year’s annual report it cited “alarming departures from democratic norms” to explain why India showed the steepest decline in scores among major democracies. In September, Amnesty International closed its India operations after what it called a government “witch hunt.”
Earlier this year, in an essay in Foreign Affairs, Mr. Biden pledged to “put strengthening democracy back on the global agenda.” It’s too soon to say if this will have any effect in India, but it isn’t premature to predict that a Biden administration will turn U.S. policy back toward its traditional moorings. The state of Indian democracy won’t top the bilateral agenda, but nor will it vanish from view as it did over the past four years.

2020/11/12,Biden Knows What the Other Side Is Thinking,Declarations,https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-knows-what-the-other-side-is-thinking-11605223988,"Where are we? Waiting, as the process plays out. In a week of talking to Republican political leaders, all by nature competitive, most veterans of tough races, I haven’t found one who believes Donald Trump won. All believe that there was fraud in the vote, and that this year’s semicrazy pandemic rules made clear the need for some baseline national voting standards. But none believe, though some seemed hoping, there was enough fraud to change the result.
They expect this will become clear through failed lawsuits and the production by the states of final certified votes. Would it be better if Republican senators, say, came forward and asserted the obvious, that Joe Biden won? Yes, if only for the sake of honesty and to show the Biden half of the country that they can see and have eyes. 
But here is a rough sense of how some senators see things. They are leaders in a sharply, at times violently divided country and represent a party half of whose base is fed, daily, algorithmic incitements to suspicion and anger. The president leads this, fans it, gains from it. They lack the credibility with Mr. Trump’s base that the president has. They don’t want to jeopardize themselves over something that will be resolved through time. So hold off, lower the temperature, support the system. Recounts and court decisions will reassure some voters that every effort was made to get at the truth. This can buttress confidence in democratic processes and encourage a sense of their fundamental soundness. Taking time to get it right will have the effect of tamping down a destructive stabbed-in-the-back mythology among Trump supporters inclined in that direction. 
I suspect the long process will also have the effect, in the end, of strengthening the position of the incoming president, Mr. Biden. The courts and the close states examined his victory and found it to be real. Onward.
Something happened Tuesday that I realized I didn’t think I’d witnessed in a decade. It was when Mr. Biden spoke and took a few questions in Wilmington, Del. I got the distinct impression as the old Senate veteran spoke that he knew exactly what the other side was thinking and . . . understood. He offered a pitch-perfect, bemused acceptance of the president’s behavior. Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede is “an embarrassment,” no more: “The fact that they’re not willing to acknowledge who won at this point is not of much consequence in our planning and what we’re able to do.” He condemned no one. “I hope I get a chance to speak to Mitch”—McConnell, the Senate majority leader. 
On being denied the usual courtesy of the presidential daily briefing, “Obviously the PDB would be useful, but not necessary.” 
Everyone said it was good but no, it was a small master class. 
The past few days I reached out to some wise people, accomplished individuals whose love of country has been expressed through their careers.
I told the former Indiana governor and current president of Purdue University that I was calling people I knew to be sane. “That won’t keep you busy,” Mitch Daniels said.
He was upbeat on the election. “It seems to me the country just basically said it hadn’t lost its mind. I was stunned at the success the Republicans had in the congressional elections and in the state initiatives.” 
He was hopeful about the presidential impasse. “I honestly think this mess offers an opportunity to, at the right moment, have a Goldwater moment.” That was when Republican members of Congress went to President Richard Nixon, during Watergate, and told him it was over. It was a moment of country over party. “It would signal that we got to get on with the business of the country now,” Mr. Daniels said.
 Bill Brock, a former representative, senator, cabinet member and head of the Republican National Committee, believes in his party as a constructive force in the world. He doesn’t like the president using words like “stolen” when he speaks of the election: “Of course there was some fraud. Did it change the outcome? No. . . . This leaves a situation where President Trump uses his words and his desire to go out in the field again, but the effect will be to disillusion his own supporters. He’s using their loyalty to justify the fact that he lost an election that he did not believe he’d lose. He’s using their loyalty to cover the fact he lost. And he exposes them to the hazard of finding out that the election was over and that there was no theft of adequate size to change the outcome.”

He believes Mr. Trump sent his followers on the field without weapons. His voters chose him because they were “desperate for someone who they felt understood them, that no one else hears them. They wanted a voice and they got him and he was a loud voice and he’d be heard, and he changed the world in many good ways. But that voice now is in defense of his own situation.
“Nothing will change the results in a given state. The Biden margin is now sufficient that it would take all the close states. That is not possible. To leave the impression it is possible will leave many people disillusioned.”
As for Mr. McConnell, “Mitch is trying to keep people together so there’s some coherence” when the process is over. 
Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice calls for sensitivity and a sense of mutual give. On Sunday she tweeted: “Congratulations President-elect @JoeBiden and Vice President-elect @KamalaHarris.” 
But she also told me, “We need to worry about how bitterly divided we are. The level of anger is so high.” Trump supporters feel he was never given a chance: “I think we all need to take a deep breath. More than 70 million Americans voted for President Trump, and some reassurance through the process that this has been done fairly is not a bad thing.” 
“It will be better when all this is over, and done expeditiously. I trust, and I think most Americans trust, the courts to get this right.” 
As for the transition, “most of what you need to do in a transition you can do without the formality. The hardest part is getting your team in place, making personnel decisions, and then vetting those you’ve chosen. It’s not ideal that it hasn’t formally started. It would have been ideal to have it settled on election night and ideal to have a ‘normal’ transition, but they are experienced people.” 
On the withholding of the presidential daily briefing, she says, “Sen. Harris has served on the Intelligence Committee, there is not much that will surprise her. Joe Biden has been vice president for eight years. The idea that we’re endangering national security is, I think, overblown.”
She is a veteran of Bush v. Gore. The official Bush transition didn’t begin until after the Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 12, 2000. Until then everything was uncertain—“it all came down to 537 votes in Florida, not multiple states with significant margins. I remember Gov. Bush calling me and saying, ‘I’d like you to be national security adviser.’ And I thought but didn’t say, ‘Yes sir, if you’re president.’ ”
Like everyone else I spoke to she wanted to see election reform. 
Beyond that: “Trust the process that we are in. Our institutions work.”

2020/11/12,Joe Biden’s Lockdown Lobby,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-bidens-lockdown-lobby-11605223647,"Did you enjoy the days at home from mid-March to May? The 22 million lost jobs, the shuttered storefronts, the neighborhood shops out of business, the kids unable to attend school, and the near economic depression? Well, congratulations, a reprise may be coming your way if Joe Biden heeds his Covid-19 advisory team.
We’ve told you about Ezekiel Emanuel, the advisory committee member who wanted new lockdowns during the summer flare-up in the Sunbelt states. Lucky for the country that his only power then was appearing on MSNBC.
Then there’s Michael Osterholm, also a member of the Biden Covid committee, who now wants a new nationwide lockdown for as many as six weeks. Dr. Osterholm is director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. CNBC quoted him as suggesting that we are about to enter “Covid hell” and the government should lock everyone up as we await a vaccine.
“We could pay for a package right now to cover all of the wages, lost wages for individual workers for losses to small companies to medium-sized companies or city, state, county governments. We could do all of that,” Dr. Osterholm said, according to Yahoo Finance. “If we did that, then we could lock down for four to six weeks.”
Lockdowns are the good doctor’s household remedy. In August he and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari argued for harsher lockdowns. “The problem with the March-to-May lockdown was that it was not uniformly stringent across the country. For example, Minnesota deemed 78 percent of its workers essential,” the duo wrote in the New York Times. “To be effective, the lockdown has to be as comprehensive and strict as possible.”
Did they learn anything from the spring and events since? Lockdowns don’t crush the virus. They merely delay its spread until the lockdowns end. Targeted restrictions on people and businesses may be needed in an emergency in some locations to prevent hospitals from being overrun—though even then the government can surge medical resources, as is now happening in El Paso. 
The costs of severe lockdowns are horrendous. The U.S. is still recovering from the spring catastrophe when the jobless rate surged in two months to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. Tens of thousands of businesses closed and many will never reopen. 
The human cost is even worse. A quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds have reported suicidal thoughts and increased substance abuse. Half of them reported symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey in June. Some 13% of Americans said they started or increased substance use to cope with the pandemic.
Dr. Osterholm seems to think all of this harm can be alleviated if the government writes another giant check. But the feds have already appropriated nearly $3 trillion, the Federal Reserve is adding hundreds of billions, and the federal debt is now 100% of GDP and rising. Will $3 trillion more do it, or will we need $10 trillion? 
This awful advice arrives as the economy continues to recover from the first shutdowns. Third-quarter growth was a record 33.1% and the fourth quarter has started strong. Continuing jobless claims fell again in Thursday’s weekly report by another 436,000, and new claims by 48,000. The U.S. has recovered more than half of the jobs it lost, and the jobless rate has fallen to 6.9%. Where would we be now if we’d have taken Dr. Osterholm’s advice in August, or Dr. Emanuel’s in June?
Covid cases are accelerating, to a worrying degree in some places. Hospitalizations are rising, and deaths will follow, though many fewer per infection than in the spring thanks to clinical advances in treating the disease. But we should have learned by now that the best response to these surges is to protect the vulnerable, maintain social-distance protocols and wear masks when in close quarters indoors while getting on as much as possible with normal life, education and commerce. 
The Biden team would have more credibility on lockdowns if they and Mr. Biden were more consistent in their Covid admonitions. But they stayed silent about last weekend’s public celebrations over Mr. Biden’s declaration of victory, and we don’t recall their warnings during the summer racial-justice protests. No wonder so many Americans ignore Covid warnings when they see this double standard.
The problem with Mr. Biden’s advisory committee is that its members are part of the conformist Covid clerisy who think that lockdowns dictated from on high are good for the little people. He ought to diversify his advice by calling in the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration on the alternative policy of “focused protection.”
On current trend Mr. Biden will inherit a recovering economy and a pipeline of better Covid therapies and likely vaccines. His job will be to extend this progress, not to send the country back into the despond of April. If he does return to lockdowns, he’ll own the economic and public-health consequences.

2020/11/12,Covid and the Church in Delaware,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-and-the-church-in-delaware-11605223486,"A pandemic doesn’t override the Constitution, and it’s a shame that preserving its liberties from politicians has often required litigation. On Wednesday Delaware Gov. John Carney settled with a pastor who went to court claiming that state emergency orders discriminated against houses of worship. 
Mr. Carney had declared churches essential, but last spring he also imposed restrictions that went beyond what he required of other essential businesses. One order mandated that church services last no longer than an hour, while another stated that “there must be at least a four-hour gap between the end of one in-person service and the beginning of the next in-person service.” 
State guidance also told churches to “encourage all vulnerable individuals,” including anyone 65 and older, “to continue to shelter in place.” Law firms, liquor stores and other essential businesses endured no comparable restrictions. So gramps could go out to buy a quart of vodka but not to pray.
Worshippers could attend drive-in services, but only if they parked 15 feet from each other and rolled the windows only half way down. Baptisms were permitted, but only if a pastor wore a mask, applied hand sanitizer before and after any anointments, and refrained from holding the baptismal candidate.
“The governor’s edicts and restrictions went too far, and the church was the target,” says Rev. Christopher Alan Bullock, the pastor of a Baptist church in Wilmington. “All these things were unnecessary, and we felt that particularly small African-American churches that didn’t have the financial resources to go online, they would be handcuffed in the ability not to meet, preach the gospel, and sustain themselves financially.”
 Jonathan Starkey, a spokesman for Mr. Carney, says the virus “doesn’t distinguish between a church, your restaurant, or your living room.” This week’s settlement ensures the Governor won’t either. Mr. Carney agreed to treat churches neutrally, to avoid imposing restrictions applicable only to religious rituals like baptism, not to impose age limits on attendees, and not to issue mandates targeting churches or religious ministries. Praise the Lord.

2020/11/12,Harvard vs. Asian-Americans,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/harvard-vs-asian-americans-11605223446,"Harvard won its big racial preferences case in a Solomonic verdict by the First Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday that Harvard’s use of race isn’t perfect, but it’s good enough. We hope the Supreme Court will be the final judge of that. 
The case was brought by Students for Fair Admissions, which argues that Harvard’s use of race favors whites, blacks and Hispanics at the expense of Asian-Americans. In October 2019, a district judge ruled that even if Asian-Americans are penalized, it’s “justified by the compelling interest in diversity and all the benefits that flow from a diverse college population.” The First Circuit agreed, adding that Harvard’s use of race “is consistent with the requirements of Supreme Court precedent.” 
And there’s the rub. These cases keep coming up because the Supreme Court’s decisions on race are so murky. A divided Court has spent the last decades saying the limited use of race in admissions is permissible—but without drawing clear lines about how or how much. 
No wonder the First Circuit took 104 pages to issue its ruling, carefully repeating the factual record about how Harvard uses race in the name of diversity. Harvard never explains precisely how it uses race in admissions, but the court says that’s fine because the school uses other subjective admissions criteria as well. The ambiguity means schools can use race in arbitrary fashion as long as they’re not too blatant.
The good news is that the First Circuit accepted Harvard’s practices as is and didn’t send the case back to the university to adjust one or two practices—and thus start the whole legal process again. This makes the case ripe for appeal to the Supreme Court, which has three new Justices since its last big case on racial preferences in admissions, Fisher v. University of Texas, in 2016. 
We hope they take the case. As Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out in his dissent from the Court’s refusal to hear a controversial abortion case, the Founders gave Justices lifetime tenure so they could rise above the politics of the day and serve the cause of justice. 
The time may also be ripe politically. The U.S. is far more ethnically diverse than it once was, with many more groups qualifying as minorities. In the Harvard case, Asian-Americans are the aggrieved party, not white Americans. 
That insight may help explain why Californians last week rejected, in a 56.8% to 43.2% rout, an attempt to reintroduce race-based preferences to their government’s decisions. A Pew Research survey in 2019 found that a majority of Americans overwhelmingly reject considering race in college admissions. Time for the Supreme Court to meet the moment.

2020/11/12,We Don’t Need Government Mandates for Covid Vaccination,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/we-dont-need-government-mandates-for-covid-vaccination-11605222059,"Covid-19 vaccines are almost here. Pfizer announced Monday that its vaccine has proved more than 90% effective in clinical trials. But vaccines are useless unless people take them, and it’s likely many will refuse. 
The drumbeat is growing louder for the government to mandate vaccination. On Saturday the New York State Bar Association urged Albany to require Covid-19 vaccines for all New Yorkers regardless of religious objection. While courts have upheld state vaccine mandates in the past, a societywide mandate would be overbroad and unduly coercive. Private initiatives will work better.
Only 45% of American adults get vaccinated for influenza annually. Concerns about side effects and doubts about effectiveness are the two main reasons people skip the vaccine, according to the University of Chicago’s NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. In a NORC survey conducted at the height of the pandemic in May, Americans expressed similar concerns about a prospective Covid-19 vaccine. While a majority claimed they would likely be vaccinated, far fewer were a definite yes. Less than half said they would definitely be vaccinated, and doubts about safety and effectiveness were common. 
The Biden campaign and others have alleged that vaccine makers and the Food and Drug Administration are moving too fast toward approval—claims the FDA and drug companies vehemently deny—further eroding public trust in an eventual vaccine. A Pew Research Center poll found that the number of Americans who would definitely or probably be vaccinated fell to 51% in September from 72% in May.
All 50 states have statutory mandates for vaccination against specific childhood diseases, and all but two allow religious exemptions. While about half of states have influenza vaccination rules for health-care and long-term care facilities, including assessing vaccination status and offering free vaccines, only a minority of these mandate that facilities ensure their staffs and patients are vaccinated. All allow religious exemptions. 
Multiple courts have upheld these requirements and other public-health measures as a legitimate exercise of states’ police powers to protect public health and safety. Nearly every case relies on the Supreme Court decision Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), which upheld a smallpox-vaccination mandate against a due-process challenge. While Jacobson cautioned that courts could interfere against “arbitrary and oppressive” actions that “might go so far beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public,” the case is routinely cited to validate public-health actions that infringe on constitutional rights.
Indiscriminate reliance on Jacobson continues despite subsequent Supreme Court cases recognizing fundamental liberty interests in marriage and procreation, and liberty interests in bodily integrity and personal autonomy that support the right to refuse medical treatments. As the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently opined in In re Abbott, upholding state Covid-19 surgery moratoriums that include procedural abortions, “Jacobson instructs that all constitutional rights”—the emphasis is in the original—“may be reasonably restricted to combat a public health emergency.” 
But Jacobson isn’t an apt guide for Covid-19. It dealt with a populationwide mandate during a smallpox epidemic. Smallpox was eradicated in 1980, but it was a recurrent scourge in 1905. It killed 3 out of 10 of those infected. Those who survived were usually left scarred, sometimes blind. It spread easily and affected all ages. Smallpox warranted a vigorous state response, even one that encroached on individual liberties. 
Covid-19 is more like influenza than smallpox. It kills 0.2% to 0.6% of those infected. Its severest effects are on populations that are smaller and more discrete than those at risk from either smallpox or influenza. The elderly and people with comorbidities account for most Covid-19 deaths and hospitalizations. Old age and comorbidities converge in residents of long-term care facilities, who account for 45% of Covid-19 deaths. Covid-19 merits a more targeted, less coercive response than smallpox.
Private industry will do better than 50 state governments in crafting narrow mandates. Private entities have financial and reputational incentives to protect their employees, patrons and residents, and are therefore well-positioned to determine what protective measures, including vaccination, need to be taken in specific circumstances. Vaccinated employees are less likely to become ill or infect their co-workers, thus reducing absenteeism. A vaccinated workforce will incur lower health-care costs, which could ultimately reduce premiums for employer-provided health insurance. A vaccine-protected enterprise will have a competitive advantage in attracting safety-conscious customers and employees. Finally, requiring vaccination could limit tort liability for failing to protect customers and other workers from infection and satisfy government requirements to keep workplaces safe.
Even before Covid-19, health-care facilities, including those providing long-term care, were increasingly requiring employees and residents to be vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases. Private mandates don’t violate statutory and constitutional constraints as long as reasonable accommodations are made for those with medical conditions that make vaccination risky and those with genuine religious objections. 
Failing to ensure that Covid-19 vaccines are used would unnecessarily prolong the pandemic. Private initiatives creating narrow mandates that target those most likely to benefit from vaccines, alongside voluntary vaccination, will maximize public health while minimizing the threat to individual liberties.

2020/11/12,Christmas Is in (and on) the Air,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/christmas-is-in-and-on-the-air-11605222024,"‘Why can’t every day be like Christmas?” the actor-songwriter Red West mused in 1965. The next year, his pal Elvis Presley released the completed song, which reasons, “What a wonderful world this would be.” More than half a century later, the nation’s music- and video-service firms are thinking the same thing. Seeking to cheer up a population that has endured pandemic, economic misery and political chaos, they’re betting that Christmas-themed entertainment is what’s needed.
In September radio station WWIZ in Youngstown, Ohio, rebranded itself “The Valley’s Christmas Station,” with a playlist featuring songs like Johnny Mathis’s “It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas.” It felt like a bit of a stretch ahead of the first frost. According to the showbiz paper Variety, larger stations across the country such as KOST in Los Angeles went to all-holiday offerings soon after Halloween, earlier than usual.
In my youth, radio was a link to the holidays, with annual “Countdown to Christmas” playlists leading up to the tension-filled tracking of Santa on Christmas Eve. But no outlet dared cue this fare until after Thanksgiving. Once the turkey was done, DJs began mixing in a few Christmas songs, gradually increasing their frequency until finally, a week or so before the holiday, it was all-Christmas.
This year SiriusXM fired up 14 of its 17 holiday music channels in late October. Television, too, is rushing the season. Disney’s Freeform cable channel launched its Christmas programming on Nov. 1, a month earlier than in 2019. The Hallmark Channel’s Christmas marathon began on Oct. 23, the same day Lifetime triggered its Christmas barrage. UPtv began running more than 500 hours of holiday fare in its “Merry Movie Christmas” package on Nov. 1. Too soon?
Like many people, I’m seduced by songs of the season. Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” first recorded in 1994, makes me smile. But blaring from my car radio on Election Day, it was unsettling and out of place.
Some psychologists warn that too much holiday music too early in the season can be stressful. If you’re easily overwhelmed by the need to buy gifts, entertain guests and decorate the house—all during a pandemic—maybe you’d rather not think about Christmas while panicking over Thanksgiving dinner.
Some radio stations tried programming Christmas music last spring as a balm during quarantine. It didn’t work. For many listeners, the gambit made a special holiday lose significance. Now stations are jumping the season partly out of economic desperation. Ad revenue has slumped during the pandemic, but since tune-in usually rises during the holiday-music season, an early boost in audience levels would be a welcome gift.
Personally, I’m looking forward to a “Holly, Jolly Christmas.” But for the next few weeks at least, I’d prefer a silent night.

2020/11/12,Joe Biden’s Mandate Is to Heal Our Nation,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-bidens-mandate-is-to-heal-our-nation-11605219340,"Regarding your editorial “Joe Biden’s Non-Mandate” (Nov. 6): Should Mr. Biden be confirmed as president elect, he will have been chosen with a very clear mandate: Heal the nation. Pull away from the extremes and try to find common ground. 
The conservative media, which includes some of your columnists, have tried to label Mr. Biden a puppet of the progressive left. While his voting record has been left of center, as vice president Mr. Biden facilitated the 60 votes that resulted in the Affordable Care Act. That may not have been the direction you wanted to see the country go but, ultimately, it proved popular. 
Raising taxes on those earning over $400,000, asking Americans to wear masks and taking steps to fight the battle against climate change might be left of center but these policies are hardly as aggressive as the party’s progressive wing wants. In fact, as the campaign progressed, he constantly spoke against much of the progressive agenda. 
What Americans dislike about President Trump isn’t his policies as much as his approach, his visceral attacks on all who disagree with him and his constant lies. Americans, more than anything, want to see Democrats and Republicans work together to find common ground. Mr. Biden has survived almost a half-century in Washington working with others to find common ground. He knows that “common” means toward the middle, not to the extremes. 
If Ronald Reagan could work with Tip O’Neill and Bill Clinton with Newt Gingrich, then why is it so far-fetched to think Joe Biden can work with Mitch McConnell ?

2020/11/12,Progressives May Lead the Democrats Astray,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/progressives-may-lead-the-democrats-astray-11605219238,"In “Democrats, Let Progressives Lead” (op-ed, Nov. 10), Cenk Uygur is surely right that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer keep on skating despite their many failures, but putting the progressives in charge? The loss of seats in the House, the nonappearance of the blue wave and the losses in state legislatures all suggest the electorate’s rejection of the very ideas progressives have been noisily and assiduously pushing. And when Mr. Uygur says, “Republican politicians, whom I loathe,” he rather gives the game away, doesn’t he? I suspect I’m not alone in thinking the public has had enough of divisive hatred masquerading as policy proposals.
Bill Marsano
New York
Progressives have been leading since the 2018 election. Before that, Mrs. Pelosi promised to work with the president to pass meaningful legislation, and to not spend time and treasure on endless investigations. Yet once the Democrats took control of Congress and handed Mrs. Pelosi the speaker’s gavel, the country was rewarded with Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and “the Squad.” We were further rewarded with a sham impeachment. When that failed, we were rewarded with nightly riots, featuring some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, occupied by the very minorities the progressives claim to represent, being burned to the ground. All the while we had progressive politicians claiming these riots were “peaceful protests,” and anything destroyed was just “property that could be replaced.” A compliant national media parroted the progressive narrative. And now, Robert Reich wants to establish some kind of “truth and reconciliation commission,” and Rep. Ocasio-Cortez wants an official “enemies list,” something President Nixon was properly vilified for. I guess propriety now depends upon who one’s enemies are.
Progressives led the resistance and the charge for two years since 2018. Their reward was diminished control of the House and, likely, no control of the Senate. They may have claimed the scalp of Donald Trump, but he had more to do with that than any progressive policies might have had.
Bryan Kadrich
St. Clair Shores, Mich.
Mr. Uygur shows precisely why progressives such as he are incapable of leading the Democratic Party or, for that matter, any political party in the U.S. In telling establishment Democrats to “get out of the way,” he explains that: “We know how to fight Republicans.” And that is his fatal problem. He knows how to fight. He and his ilk don’t know how to compromise and work together.
Lenny Cooperman
Feeding Hills, Mass.
Mr. Uygur doesn’t get it. The rigid, socialistic cancel culture of the far left has been repudiated. It scared a lot of people into voting for President Trump as the lesser of two evils.
Robert D. Dyson
Portland, Ore.
Cenk Uygur saying that progressives “know how to make our case” is pretty unconvincing considering he took fourth place in a Democratic congressional primary earlier this year and couldn’t crack 7%. And this in very progressive California.
Ross Feldman
Scarsdale, N.Y.
Mr. Uygur personifies the anger that defines the far left. Its members seek to turn the battle of ideas into a war of feelings. Note he did not say, “Republicans whose policies I believe are wrong” or “we know how to challenge Republican theology.” No, read his words again: “loathe,” “fight.”
Walter Sparks
Chesterfield Mo.
Does Mr. Uygur expect to convert the 72 million Trump voters to a progressive ticket?
The last thing America needs is a movement away from the center and an increase in the sentiments that divide us. This election should give no reason to encourage that direction or support it.

Mike Kerrigan laments the difficulties in “The Fog of Worship With Facemasks” (Houses of Worship, Nov. 5). But the real difficulty is far more ominous. 
Warm, moist, exhaled breath condensing on glasses interfering with vision shows air is escaping around the mask. A virus-infected mask wearer is a potential virus spreader. If air can escape around a mask, it can also be inhaled from virus-laden air by the mask wearer.
Glasses fogging means the protection the mask provides is compromised. You can become infected. In fact, this may be more likely as you will have false confidence and may become less cautious.
A protective mask is functional only if all the air goes through mask filtering, not around it. The very serious message of foggy glasses is to use a better sealing, properly fitted mask.

2020/11/13,Alito Defends the Courts,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/alito-defends-the-courts-11605309587,"Pundits and academics have worried a great deal about democratic norms in recent years, but most have gone silent when it comes to progressive assaults on judicial independence. So credit to Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito for delivering a forceful repudiation of recent efforts to intimidate American courts.
Justice Alito’s Thursday address came at the Federalist Society’s National Lawyers Convention, a wide-ranging event that included spirited debate on presidential power, intellectual property law, social justice and more. The conservative-leaning Federalist Society is above all a forum for open intellectual exchange, but it’s increasingly stigmatized by progressive activists, perhaps out of resentment for its commitment to principle.
Justice Alito spoke against a recent effort to “hobble the debate that the Federalist Society fosters” by barring judges from membership. Attacks on the Federalist Society have gone along with more explicit threats to judicial independence. Earlier this year Sen. Chuck Schumer stood in front of the Supreme Court and declared, “I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.” 
This came after five Democratic Senators threatened in a 2019 amicus brief that the Supreme Court could be “restructured” if it didn’t rule their way in a gun case. Justice Alito addressed that directly. 
“It was an affront to the Constitution and the rule of law,” he said. “The Supreme Court was created by the Constitution, not by Congress. Under the Constitution, we exercise the judicial power of the United States. Congress has no right to interfere with that work any more than we have the right to legislate.” 
Many progressives pointed out gleefully this year—at least when they thought Democrats were about to win the Senate—that nothing in the Constitution prevents Congress from packing the Court to turn it into a legislative House of Lords. But judicial independence remains an important feature of any society that values individual rights. Some are describing Justice Alito’s defense of the judiciary as political. But if the mainstream press had denounced the court-packers—the way it rightly does President Trump’s attacks on individual judges—then Justice Alito wouldn’t have to speak out.
After all, Justice Alito noted, after the threatening amicus brief, the Court “did exactly what . . . the Senators wanted” when it declared the case moot and issued no ruling. He made clear he isn’t saying that the Court acted out of fear of the Senators, but he said he worries that the result of the case could be viewed that way by “Senators and others with thoughts of bullying the Court.”
Justice Alito also highlighted some of the liberties that an independent judiciary protects. He pointed to litigation against a Christian-owned pharmacy in Washington to force it to carry drugs that the owners considered abortifacients. And he highlighted some of the pressure that progressives have put on religious liberty after the Obergefell decision protecting same-sex marriage, including a Colorado baker who had a religious objection to baking a cake for a same-sex couple.
That the left is describing Justice Alito’s attention to the First Amendment’s free exercise clause as political proves his point. Majorities often want to compel conformity to their views. The American judiciary, in its best tradition, balances majoritarian demands with the constitutional rights of weaker and less politically powerful groups, whether they are socialist or conservative.
The left may use Justice Alito’s remarks as an excuse to say that the Court is political, but he wasn’t political in any partisan sense. He was defending judicial independence and core constitutional principles. This won’t make him popular on the legal left that wants to see the Court legislate its preferences, but everyone else should thank him for telling the truth about what’s at stake.
The Democrats may have failed in their 2020 court-packing campaign as voters declined to deliver them majorities that would make this possible. But the campaign itself shows that judicial independence is now a fragile American norm, subject to political whims. Justice Alito was right to defend it.

2020/11/13,Seattle’s New Theory of Crime,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/seattles-new-theory-of-crime-11605309361,"Attorney General William Barr pronounced Seattle an “anarchist jurisdiction” recently, and its progressive political rulers seem determined to prove his point. When rioters took over several downtown blocks this summer, Mayor Jenny Durkan proclaimed a “summer of love.” Now Councilwoman Lisa Herbold is preparing to introduce a bill that would give some residents a legal pass to commit misdemeanors. 
Under Ms. Herbold’s novel theory of affirmative defense, criminals could claim they committed misdemeanors under “duress” because of their poverty, drug or alcohol abuse or other “behavioral health” issues. Scott Lindsay, a former public safety adviser to the mayor’s office, has warned that Ms. Herbold’s plan “would essentially create a legal loophole” and “a green light for crime.” 
Seattle law currently lists more than 100 misdemeanors, including thefts of less than $750, indecent exposure, unlawful use of a weapon for intimidation, and some forms of harassment and assault. So if someone committed one of these crimes but then claimed “duress” under this new and expanded definition, would a judge have an obligation to dismiss or a jury have an obligation to acquit? Ms. Herbold has yet to introduce the full text of her plan, but a model proposal released by the King County Department of Public Defense suggests yes.
The idea has received a warm reception among Seattle’s progressives. Council President Lorena González said, “I do support the policy outcomes and goals” in Ms. Herbold’s plan, and “I continue to believe that it is time to stop the criminalization of poverty, mental illness and addiction.” Kshama Sawant of the Socialist Alternative party urged her fellow Councilmembers to pass the plan without delay. And in a letter to the City Council, Seattle’s city attorney Peter Holmes noted that “several of the provisions” Ms. Herbold has proposed would “codify what my office already practices.”
The summer of love is over, as is the election, and we’d hoped to see a return to a more law-abiding Seattle. Instead, Ms. Herbold hopes to give the lawbreakers legal sanction to carry on with the mischief. Seattle businesses, keep that plywood up.

2020/11/13,New York’s Kids Aren’t All Right,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-yorks-kids-arent-all-right-11605309264,"New York City Mayor Michael Mulgrew on Friday told parents to brace for another schools shutdown on Monday. Ok, he’s the teachers union chief, not the mayor. But he might as well be as Mayor Bill de Blasio follows his orders. Nice that they give parents a weekend’s warning on closures, but as usual they’re not thinking about the children. 
Mr. de Blasio said Friday the city’s seven-day testing positive rate had hit 2.83% and is on the brink of exceeding the 3% threshold the city had set in the summer for shutting schools. This benchmark is based on the city population, not schools. Merely 0.074% of students have tested positive over the last two months, and 0.0011% on Nov. 11.
If New York City’s 1,126,000 million student population was its own metro region, it would have among the lowest per-capita case rates in the U.S. Only 955 of the 150,000 or so public school employees have tested positive since mid-September. Most evidence shows children are less likely to transmit the virus than adults, so schools are less likely to be sources of contagion than are the city’s restaurants or offices, which are still open.
Brown University economics professor Emily Oster, who has been tracking virus cases at a sample of schools with more than three million students and 422,000 staff, reports there have been substantially fewer cases among students and teachers than among local populations. No matter. Mr. Mulgrew asserted Thursday that “the virus will infiltrate the schools” and spread it around the city. 
The union-ordered shutdown isn’t surprising since their last priority is children. Hence they fight ferociously to block charter school expansions and to keep bad teachers in classrooms. Reams of data show that closing schools in the spring has cost students substantially.
A recent Stanford University study of 19 states estimates that students lost on average between 57 to 183 days of learning in reading and 136 to 232 days in math during the spring closures. New York City students lost 122 days in reading and 209 in math—essentially a year of education in a few months. 
These learning losses are why European countries are keeping schools open even as they lock down businesses again. A report from the United Kingdom found that reading comprehension scores among young students declined 15% in the last year. Scores for students from the lowest-income schools dropped nearly twice as much in vocabulary and grammar as in the wealthiest.
Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania estimate that lower education quality during schools’ closures “costs current students between $12,000 and $15,000 in future earnings, varying by age. By October 1, 2020, we project students in grades 1-12 had lost between $43,000 and $57,000, or 4 to 5 percent of their lifetime wage earnings.”
School closures will also burden lower-income parents who can’t work from home or afford backup child care. Congratulations, Mr. de Blasio, for making poor families poorer.

2020/11/13,Biden and Big Government,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-and-big-government-11605307850,"Democrats selected Joe Biden to be their presidential candidate this year because he was the non-Marxist alternative to socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. But just because Mr. Biden was the relative moderate among leading candidates for his party’s nomination doesn’t mean he will govern from the center. If, as expected, Mr. Biden is certified as the winner of this year’s presidential election, taxpayers should prepare for the worst. And Georgia voters should think twice before handing his party a Senate majority via two upcoming run-off elections. Both Mr. Biden’s campaign agenda and his experience as vice president suggest that still another rapid increase in federal spending is on the horizon. 
Twelve years ago this month, Mr. Biden was elected vice president in the midst of a financial panic and economic recession. At the time, Paul Krugman of the New York Times was calling for a federal economic stimulus plan of at least $600 billion. Once in office in 2009, the Obama-Biden administration went even further left, enacting a plan of roughly $800 billion.
And if Mr. Biden had gotten his way, the taxpayer pain would have been even greater. Jacob Schlesinger reports in the Journal: 
Back in 2009, $800 billion was real money. Government has since gotten much bigger, with federal spending skyrocketing through the Obama-Trump era and federal debt held by the public reaching a staggering $21 trillion.
And even though the economy has been staging a robust rebound after the spring shutdowns—adding more than 11 million jobs in six months —Mr. Biden has been calling for another historic surge in federal spending.
Last month the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that even without counting any new Covid spending, the Biden agenda would drive enormous increases in federal outlays:
The committee figured on nearly $6 trillion in new federal debt under the Biden program. And right now the federal balance sheet isn’t exactly in pristine condition. This week the Congressional Budget Office reported:
So the debt pile is now as big as our economy, and it doesn’t even count all of Washington’s unfunded entitlement promises stretching far into the future. 
***
If he’s willing to listen to the scientists, perhaps Mr. Biden can find some savings by reducing the massive climate-related spending in his proposed agenda. It seems that our future is not quite as bleak as he may have been led to believe. In the Times of London, Ben Webster reports:

2020/11/13,Last Chance for the 2016 Truth?,Business World,https://www.wsj.com/articles/last-chance-for-the-2016-truth-11605307534,"Since nobody else will tell you, I will: Donald Trump will not concede as long as it’s only the media that’s telling him that the election is over and he lost. He will give up the fight on any real authority, including the courts and state governments when they certify the result. He will do so because he knows what’s good for Trump, long-term.
Only on every single day of his presidency, and before, he told you he regards the media as unfair, biased, his enemy. You don’t have to agree with his opinion or approve of it. But journalism, first of all, is about what is—accurately describing observable realities, including the current, overblown tempest. Unfortunately, the increasing substitution of hysterical mythmaking for news is a malignancy of our time.
Which brings us to the unfinished business of 2016. From the leak of Democratic emails in July to Election Day in 2016, a torrent of news and pundit attacks on Mr. Trump focused on his alleged corrupt Russia ties. In any application of logic, this would have outweighed a millionfold any Russian Facebook or other social media activity on his behalf. In the claims of Obama intelligence chief James Clapper, in a book by the University of Pennsylvania’s Kathleen Hall Jamieson, suggesting Russia’s minuscule activities might have turned a razor-close election to Mr. Trump, this net effect is never addressed—an oversight by any serious thinker, a deliberate distortion by Mr. Clapper. It was obvious and could have been pointed out by any reporter exercising reasoned judgment, but never was.
When the 2020 race rolled around, Harris and Gallup polls showed that millions continued to believe the Steele dossier and that Mr. Trump cooperated improperly with Russia to win the White House. Mr. Trump can add this to his list of grievances and yet last week’s result is anything but a repudiation by the voters who sent him to Washington in the first place. He exercises his duties lawfully and properly for the next 67 days. He should make it his business to continue airing out 2016. An overdue act of political hygiene would be to declassify the classified section of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report on FBI chief James Comey’s actions in the Hillary Clinton email case, including his reopening of the case shortly before the election.
I won’t rehearse the details. While the cover story still held, namely that Mr. Comey had intervened because of the tarmac meeting of Bill Clinton and the Obama attorney general, a Washington Post headline declared: “Now we know: Bill Clinton cost his wife the presidency.” After the truth emerged, a headline never admitted: “Now we know: Dubious Russian intelligence in the hands of the FBI cost Mrs. Clinton the election.”
But if the truth was not emphasized to the American people, it would have hit the U.S. intelligence community like a ton of bricks: Its prestige and survival were now in danger because, while trying to protect Mrs. Clinton’s expected victory, it had clumsily helped deliver the election to Mr. Trump. Don’t doubt this fear was real for our spies and ex-spies. Mrs. Clinton’s memoir categorically declares she would have won but for Mr. Comey. The establishment’s favorite polling guru, Nate Silver, has said the same. The longtime Clinton factotum Lanny Davis devoted a book to the argument. 
What followed might be seen, from a certain angle, as one of the most successful U.S. intelligence operations in history: crowding out this story, which otherwise would have been the story of the decade, in favor of a made-up story about Mr. Trump’s Russia ties, helped by certain manipulable trolls of the national media.
But notice a couple of things. Mrs. Clinton’s shocking and unexpected defeat, which became a source of panic for the FBI and other agencies, happened after the otherwise ignorable and silly Steele dossier was already in their hands. It happened after, in July 2016, CIA chief John Brennan rushed to the White House with news that the Russians knew Hillary Clinton’s campaign had decided to slime Mr. Trump with allegations of Russia collusion.
We will not rightly understand these elements until we confront the biggest secret of 2016. Whatever you think of Mr. Comey, he would not have undertaken his insubordinate, improper and ill-advised actions in the Hillary matter (as described in the painstaking work of the Justice Department’s inspector general) without an extraordinary justification. He found that justification (as we later learned) in a secret Russian intelligence intercept that his own FBI colleagues considered false and possibly a Russian hoax.
I don’t know what’s in the inspector general’s classified appendix, but Mr. Horowitz, shortly after completing his work, publicly urged that its secrecy be reconsidered. He made no pretense about the “sources and methods” that the intelligence community so regularly invokes to hide embarrassing information. I think we know enough to know the truth is not being withheld from us for our own good.

2020/11/13,"Donald Trump, the President His Detractors Loved to Hate",Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-the-president-his-detractors-loved-to-hate-11605307421,"Donald Trump is likely to go down in history as one of the most effective and most despised one-term presidents in American politics. So despised was he by those opposed to him that even now they won’t admit his effectiveness. But until the Covid-19 crisis, which had much more to do with bringing him down than did Joe Biden and the Democratic Party, Mr. Trump’s policies had vastly lowered unemployment rates, cut away entrepreneurially inhibiting financial regulations, and revved up the stock market. His enemies called him a racist, but his opportunity zones, prison reform and encouragement of black enterprise generally did much more for African-Americans than his African-American predecessor did. In foreign policy he cut America free from a badly conceived Iran deal, made substantial strides toward peace in the Middle East, and showed himself a greater friend to Israel than any American president in recent history. 
That’s a lot, and it should have counted for a lot, had his rebarbative personality not served to negate these accomplishments. Almost daily he demonstrated he was devoid of graciousness. Without the suavity of the statesmen or the bonhomie of the practiced politician, in both his tweets and most of his public performances he revealed a taste for insult, an unrelenting boastfulness and arrogance, and a general coarseness. 
That this same coarseness—some would call it directness—appealed to more than 70 million Americans is perhaps a more complicated question. Some of my friends have expressed dismay that so many of their countrymen loyally supported Mr. Trump over the past four years. But I wonder if it was him they admired so much as his high-spirited attacks on the progressive program that seemed to have taken over the country.
Imagine yourself a member of the lower middle class recently put out of work by the Covid pandemic and worried about how you will supply your family’s basic needs in the months ahead. You turn on your television set to watch the news, and you see major American cities taken over by rioters and looters claiming they are protesting “systemic racism.” In disgust you change channels to discover kids at Yale and elsewhere denying speakers who disagree with them the right to speak, and then claiming they feel unsafe even behind ivy-covered walls. You change the channel once more to discover your local anchors are delighted to run a piece about the first trans judge in your county, a former man, now claiming to be a woman but who even in a dress looks a good deal more masculine than most. Enough, enough! Bring on Donald Trump. 
As for Mr. Trump’s claim that the press and other enemies came after him even before he inhabited the Oval Office, there is much to it. He represented everything they loathed: his wealthy upbringing, his raw capitalist spirit, his uncultivated manner, his mockery of political correctness, his unwillingness to accept and play through their early and unrelenting bias against him. 
The great charge against Mr. Trump—apart from those who wish to stress his hyperbole, his lies, his want of generosity—is the divisiveness his time in office has caused. Opinions about Mr. Trump, true enough, could divide a room of friends, ruin a family dinner, break up an engagement. And what he could do on the personal level, he also did to the nation. Neutrality about Donald Trump was nearly impossible. A friend reported that his wife was disappointed that I didn’t dislike Mr. Trump more. 
Raging opinion for and against a leader isn’t entirely without precedent. Robert Walpole, the Whig prime minister (1721-42) under Kings George I and II, set similar passions astir. The British philosopher David Hume, who prided himself on his impartiality in politics, noted “that there was never a man, whose actions and character have been more openly canvassed, than those of the present minister, who . . . might make a large library of what has been wrote for and against him.” 
Walpole’s vices, Hume went on, “are not compensated by those virtues which are nearly allayed to them. The private character of the man is better than the public. . . . With many good qualities he has incurred the public hatred: With good capacity he has not escaped ridicule.”
Hume sums up Walpole as we might sum up Mr. Trump: “During his time trade has flourished, liberty declined, and learning gone to ruin. As I am a man, I love him; as I am a scholar, I hate him; as I am a BRITON, I calmly wish his fall. And were I a member of either house, I would give my vote for removing him from ST JAMES’S; but should be glad to see him retire to HOUGHTON-HALL, to pass the remainder of his days in ease and pleasure.” 
So, today, many millions will be less than pleased to see Donald Trump, after all he has done for what they feel their interests, repair to Mar-a-Lago or another of his properties, while a few million more will be entirely pleased never to hear from him again.

2020/11/13,Trump Remade His Party and the World,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-remade-his-party-and-the-world-11605294269,"Although the American people voted not to give Donald Trump a second term, history will regard him as a consequential president—if not always for the reasons he intended.
Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he reoriented the federal judiciary, appointing three carefully vetted conservatives to the Supreme Court and 53 appellate-court judges, two shy of Barack Obama’s count during two terms. By making aggressive use of executive authority, Mr. Trump demonstrated that many limitations on presidential power are customary norms rather than legal restraints. Future presidents and Congresses will have to decide whether to ratify Mr. Trump’s expansive conception of his office or enact new limits.
On the domestic front, Mr. Trump’s most enduring legacy may be on the Republican Party. When he announced his candidacy in June 2015, the GOP was a coalition of social conservatives, national defense types and free-marketeers. Mr. Trump made his peace with social conservativism and supply-side economics—tax cuts and deregulation—while altering his party’s stance on foreign, trade and fiscal policy.
Mr. Trump endorsed robust military budgets while challenging party orthodoxy on alliances and the use of American power. “America first” represented a shift away from internationalism toward self-interest understood mainly in economic terms. He repudiated what he called “endless wars,” especially those initiated by George W. Bush, and turned away from democracy promotion, which Ronald Reagan and Mr. Bush emphasized.
Mr. Trump’s revisions to party orthodoxy in economic policy were equally far-reaching. From President Eisenhower to Speaker Paul Ryan, Republicans favored balancing the budget, even if some were more talk than action. Mr. Trump barely paid it lip service. In his announcement speech, he promised to “save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts,” adding for emphasis: “Have to do it.” During his first campaign, he proudly called himself the “king of debt”; later he presided over a trillion-dollar annual deficit even before the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Although white working-class voters began moving away from the Democratic Party half a century earlier, Mr. Trump was the first Republican nominee to make their concerns central to his policy. He shifted away from open trade governed by multilateral agreements toward managed bilateral deals, and he made eliminating trade deficits and restoring factory jobs key objectives for trade deals. On immigration, he ended the split between Republican elected officials and working-class voters, who regarded a large inflow of immigrants as a threat to their jobs and way of life. Republicans who had backed comprehensive immigration reform—as did both Reagan and Mr. Bush—found themselves sidelined.
The president’s policy shifts changed the Republican coalition. The Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce shifted away from the GOP, and the chamber endorsed 23 freshman House Democrats as well as 29 Republicans. Joe Biden made strong gains in the suburbs, including traditionally Republican exurbs. Mr. Trump’s more modest gains in small towns and rural counties weren’t enough to stop swing states—Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and apparently Georgia—from moving into the Democratic column. The president’s no-holds-barred appeals to the working class turned out to be effective among black and Latino voters (especially men) as well as white ones, but could still end up shrinking the Republican coalition in the long run.
In 2024, some candidates may advocate returning to the party’s pre-Trump stances on fiscal policy, trade and immigration. They are likely to face an uphill battle. So long as working-class economic and cultural concerns play a central role in shaping the party’s agenda, suburban professionals and corporate leaders will be forced to choose between taking a back seat in their party and realigning with the Democrats, whose views on some issues are closer to theirs. 
Yet the election of 2020 was nothing like the root-and-branch repudiation of Trumpism that Democrats (and not a few Republicans) had hoped for. It was a personal defeat for Mr. Trump but a victory for his party, which outperformed expectations in the Senate and made gains in the House and state legislatures. If the 2024 Republican nominee isn’t Mr. Trump himself, it will likely be someone who embraces the president’s orientation without his loud rhetoric and character flaws. 
In foreign policy, Mr. Trump has presided over—and in some cases hastened—the end of several eras:
• The China integration era. Both political parties have abandoned the hopeful thesis that economic growth will lead Beijing to embrace democracy and the Western economic order. Instead, Xi Jinping’s domination of Chinese politics has ended halting moves toward political and economic liberalization. Unless his model of a state-dominated economy, enforced political and cultural uniformity, fervent nationalism, and drive for regional hegemony hits a wall, China will remain a revisionist power with which opportunities for cooperation will be limited.
• The era of unchecked globalization. Political conflict and the Covid-19 pandemic have heightened doubts about relying on global supply chains. Because efficiency often comes at the expense of resilience, policy makers and business leaders are groping toward a new balance. The drive for self-reliance in strategically important sectors—defense, information technology and health, among others—will call for targeted public investment and the transfer of some production facilities to the U.S. or reliable partners such as Canada and Mexico.
• The 9/11 era. American patience with what leaders of both parties call “endless wars” has run out. Residual forces may remain in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the U.S. will no longer fight Islamist terrorism with large ground deployments in the Middle East. If Iran attacks American interests in the region, retaliation may be necessary, but American administrations will remain reluctant to enter a full-fledged military conflict with Tehran. 
• The Israel-Palestinian era. Although the U.S. will continue to encourage a negotiated solution, the Trump administration’s diplomacy has encouraged many Arab states to stop conditioning their stance toward Israel on a final resolution with the Palestinians. The Saudis may be slow to follow the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in establishing formal ties with the Jewish state, but the formalization of links between those countries and Israel couldn’t have happened without Saudi assent. The conflict between Sunni Arab states and Iran, Syria and Hezbollah dominates the region. Israel is firmly in the Sunni camp, and Mr. Biden will have difficulty returning to the Obama-era détente with Iran unless Tehran agrees to curb its support for terrorist groups. 
• The era of transnational threats and alliances. Although Democrats insist on the continuing significance of issues such as climate change, migration and nuclear proliferation, both parties now acknowledge the return of great-power rivalries, especially with Russia and China.
The U.S. and Europe might have gone their separate ways after the Cold War ended. Instead, America’s standing as the world’s only superpower made possible, even invited, involvement in conflicts from the Balkans to the Middle East and Libya. Although the U.S. and Europe didn’t always agree, both understood them as quarrels within a family united by shared values. Both accepted the continuing utility of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the broad commonality of economic interests between the U.S. and Europe.
America’s leadership rested not only on might, but also on predictability. Mr. Trump’s election, and his attacks on NATO and the European Union, shattered European confidence that American politics would oscillate within fixed limits. Europeans now believe that substantial numbers of Americans have no investment in NATO or the EU and see Washington’s 75-year leadership of the world’s democracies as a burden they would like to lay down. “Europeans are afraid that there is no longer a foreign-policy consensus in the United States,” Ivan Krastev of the Bulgaria-based Center for Liberal Strategies has observed. “Every new administration can mean a totally new policy, and for them this is a nightmare.” 
Although Mr. Biden’s election will improve the tone of trans-Atlantic relations, America’s political polarization is leading some Europeans to reconsider their basic strategies for security and prosperity. Some are beginning to think seriously about “strategic autonomy,” and many are reluctant to take sides in the rising conflict between the U.S. and China.
Finally, the Trump presidency has crystallized a fundamental shift in Americans’ view of the future. 
For centuries, the idea of an inexorable movement to a more peaceful, prosperous and rational world has been central to Western thought. The century of economic advancement and European stability after the 1814-15 Congress of Vienna produced a burst of confidence in historical progress, culminating in the belief that the dense network of intra-European ties had rendered war between major European powers irrational and outmoded. 
Two world wars, the rise of fascism, and the emergence of the Soviet Union as a global competitor shattered this confidence. A new generation hardened by bloody war and bitter peace came to see freedom as precious but endangered and human nature as harboring the capacity for unimaginable evil. The outcome of the struggle between liberal democracy and communism was far from assured. 
The fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union ended 75 years of threats to freedom, and progress seemed inevitable. The end of history had seemingly arrived, and the world could look forward to the steady spread of freedom and open markets. 
The number of democracies rose significantly, and previously closed economies entered the global economy. As models of governance and economics converged, optimists believed, the world would become more integrated across national boundaries. The World Trade Organization and the European Union symbolized this hope. So did Barack Obama, whose election seemed to mark a new era of racial reconciliation. Mr. Obama often characterized ideas or practices he regarded as misguided as being on the “wrong side of history.” 
But the political impact of the slow recovery from the Great Recession, which had been underestimated, came into focus. The rise of authoritarian populism in some democracies, Britain’s decision to leave the EU, and the emergence of China as a political as well as an economic adversary ended a quarter-century of optimism. It became clear that the movement toward global democracy had peaked in the first decade of the 21st century. Heightened conflicts over immigration and ethnicity undermined confidence that existing arrangements were adequate to deal with cultural differences. 
With the election of Mr. Trump, each of these trends played out in the U.S. Complacency about the survival of American democracy gave way to deep concern. Mr. Trump’s critics saw him as a threat not only to racial progress and social inclusion but to the Constitution. And they came to understand that this threat represented the culmination of longstanding trends. 
Partisan polarization had not only blocked agreement on public policy but also eroded safeguards—normative as well as institutional—for our constitutional order, which the Founders designed to protect liberty by preventing undue concentrations of power. As partisan divisions paralyzed Congress, the executive and the judiciary expanded to fill the vacuum, threatening the constitutional balance among the branches. 
Mr. Obama’s policies sparked a populist backlash on the right, and critics emerged on the left as well. Immigration advocates labeled him the “deporter in chief.” African-American leaders focused on widening economic gaps between white and black Americans and racial inequities in policing and criminal justice. The deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police in 2014 set the stage for the protests that broke out this year after the killing of George Floyd. 
In the 12 years separating Mr. Obama’s first victory and Mr. Trump’s defeat, hope gave way to fear, confidence to doubt. More Americans came to understand that history doesn’t inexorably flow in a single direction and that broad cultural and political movements can spark counterreactions. Mr. Biden’s election won’t erase these sentiments. If his efforts to renew civility, bipartisanship, economic inclusion and racial reconciliation fall short, the U.S. will likely plunge into a new era of discontent, and ideas once confined to the margins of politics may become its focus.

2020/11/15,Labor vs. the ESG Racket,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-vs-the-esg-racket-11605482618,"One of the stakes in who controls the Senate in 2021 is the fate of the Trump Administration’s deregulation project. A GOP Senate could block Democrats from using of the Congressional Review Act to overturn important rules. A valuable case in point is the new Labor Department rule requiring that retirement plan managers invest in the best financial interest of their beneficiaries. 
Last month DOL finalized a rule underlining that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (Erisa) requires plan fiduciaries to act “solely in the interest” of plan participants “for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits” and “defraying reasonable expenses.” In other words, managers can’t prioritize their own pecuniary or political interests.
This shouldn’t be controversial. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer (2014) that Erisa’s reference to benefits signifies “financial” rather than “nonpecuniary” benefits. For example, a fiduciary can’t invest employees’ retirements exclusively in their own employer’s stock if the “financial goals demand the contrary,” Justices explained.
A fiduciary also can’t invest retirement assets only in companies with low carbon emissions or racially diverse workforces when these aren’t linked to financial returns. The Labor rule clarifies that financial factors are those that have a “material effect on the return and risk of an investment.”
Asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard say ESG funds perform better over the long-term, but the evidence is spotty. A Pacific Research Institute study last year found that the S&P 500 outperformed a broad basket of ESG funds over a decade by nearly 44%. One reason is many ESG funds excluded companies like Amazon,Netflix and Mastercard.
BlackRock in a public comment cites a 2015 Harvard Business School study that found firms with strong ratings on material sustainability issues had better future performance than firms with lower ratings. Ok, but if that’s the case, CEO Larry Fink and other asset managers shouldn’t have a problem complying with the new Labor rule.
Their problem is that they consider political rather than economic risks—for instance, from a Biden Administration imposing more climate regulation—that they assume financial markets don’t account for in stock prices. Many factors they deem to be “material” risks are also not clearly linked to financial performance.
Take the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, which is BlackRock’s ESG north star. SASB considers a company’s behavioral advertising, plastic consumption and revenue derived from selling no-added-sugar and artificially sweetened drinks “material.” Is bottled Glaceau Smartwater a material risk to Coca-Cola ? It has zero sugar (good), but, OMG, it’s made with plastic.
Notwithstanding the recent plunge in oil prices, BlackRock’s S&P 500 Growth ETF beat its Clean Energy ETF by an annual average of more than 10 percentage points for the five years ending May 15, according to the Institute for Pension Fund Integrity. BlackRock says ESG funds during the first quarter significantly outperformed broader indexes.
Well, yes. That’s because stock prices of energy companies have plummeted during the pandemic amid lockdowns while those of tech companies (which are weighed heavily in many ESG funds) have soared. But fiduciaries are supposed to consider long-term returns.
The reason asset mangers largely oppose the new Labor rule is because they want to use worker retirements to promote their own political and financial interests. They want to charge higher fees for managing ESG funds even if they don’t produce better financial returns for beneficiaries. The DOL rule forbids them from doing that. Kudos to Labor Secretary Gene Scalia for standing up to these Wall Street complaints.

2020/11/15,Why Democrats Nearly Lost the House,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-democrats-nearly-lost-the-house-11605482291,"Democrats nearly lost their majority in the House on Nov. 3, and their post-election recriminations show the reason. They think their problem was their packaging instead of their policies.
Democrats have already lost eight seats net and could lose as many as 13 after the counting ends. They lost two in South Florida, at least two in California, and here and there across the country in places they had gained in 2018. They failed to pick up seats in Texas, Ohio or Florida, which they had targeted. We also count some 26 seats so far that Democrats won with 52% of the vote or less, despite a huge fund-raising advantage.
The result may be the smallest House majority since 1919, and it’s especially shocking as Democrats reclaimed the White House. Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in the national popular vote by about 3.6%, while House Democratic candidates are ahead by only 2.1% (a margin that exaggerates the Democratic edge because more Democratic seats were uncontested). Democrats also had an incumbency advantage with three times as many Republican House Members retiring this year than Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blamed the losses on Mr. Trump’s ability to turn out Republicans, but the results show that Mr. Biden is more popular than are House Democrats. 
Democrats are now brawling over the reason, with progressives and swing-state Members blaming each other. Progressives refuse to take any responsibility. A post-election memo from the left-wing Justice Democrats warned Democrats against retreating from their positions on culture or economics, claiming that their agenda drove turnout. It quoted a New York Times article saying, “the key is to link racism and class conflict.”
New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blamed her defeated colleagues for not knowing how to run smart digital campaigns and how to sell progressive policies. She told CNN the problem is a weak party operation that needs to become “stronger and more resilient to Republican attacks.” She isn’t backing down from the Green New Deal or cutting funds for police, though GOP ads hammered Democrats on both issues in swing districts. 
Swing-state Members are more realistic in that they recognize the damage from GOP ads that attacked Democrats for socialism, defunding the police, raising taxes and eliminating oil and gas drilling. But these Democrats also seem to think it comes down to packaging.
“We need to not ever use the word ‘socialist’ or ‘socialism’ ever again,” Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger told her colleagues in a meeting after the election. “We lost good members because of that.” She won her seat with 50.9%.
But the socialist charge worked because in its policy essence it was true. House Democrats turned sharply leftward in the last two years as they indulged progressive priorities across the policy spectrum. They voted for huge new tax increases, vast new spending, a gradual end to fossil fuels, and the most radical labor agenda since 1935. 
The House didn’t vote to defund the police, but Member after Member indulged Black Lives Matter, which does want police budgets slashed. Max Rose, the Democrat from Staten Island, joined a BLM march that featured in a Republican attack ad. He lost. 
The problem isn’t the Democratic message; it’s the reality of their program. You can disguise your policies by not calling them “socialist,” but voters will still eventually figure out what those policies mean in practice. They know the Green New Deal means more expensive energy and an end to fracking. They know Mrs. Pelosi refused Mr. Trump’s offer of even $1.8 trillion in Covid relief as too little. 
They also know that Senate Democrats talked openly about ending the legislative filibuster, and that House and Senate Democrats advocated packing the Supreme Court. No wonder they elected more Republicans in the House and Senate as a check on these policies. 
If Democrats ignore this lesson, they’ll set themselves up for further losses in 2022. Mrs. Pelosi rules with an iron fist, but even she will find it hard to navigate her divided caucus with a narrow majority. Centrists will want to show their independence from the left. Yet if Mrs. Pelosi moves too far in the swing-seat direction, the progressives may not go along. 
Mrs. Pelosi might have to make concessions to Republicans to pass some bills. Perhaps she can consult former Republican Speaker John Boehner for advice, since the progressives could become the equivalent of the GOP Freedom Caucus of 2011 and 2012. 
Meanwhile, GOP gains in state legislative races mean that Republicans might gain several seats from the reapportionment of House districts in 2021. GOP strongholds will gain seats, while New York could lose two and California could lose one. If Democrats want to hold the House in 2022, they will have to learn the right policy lessons from 2020.

2020/11/15,Rush for the Afghan Exits?,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/rush-for-the-afghan-exits-11605482219,"President Trump has at least two months left in office, and he can use it for good or ill. One decision we hope he avoids, for the sake of the country and his own legacy, is a last-minute, rushed withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. 
It’s no secret that Mr. Trump wants to preside over troop withdrawals by Jan. 20 if not by Christmas—in Afghanistan and maybe elsewhere. The President thinks this is an unfinished part of his 2016 campaign pledge to stop “endless wars,” and he’s been frustrated that his advisers have sometimes opposed his attempts.
“We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas!” Mr. Trump tweeted on Oct. 7. His national-security adviser qualified that tweet as aspirational, but after the election the President fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had warned about a withdrawal at this time.
Then last week Mr. Trump’s choice for acting Secretary of Defense, Christopher Miller, sent a memo to U.S. forces that, among other things, said “Ending wars requires compromise and partnership. We met the challenge; we gave it our all. Now it’s time to come home.” A retired Army colonel, Douglas Macgregor, is an adviser to Mr. Miller and has been pushing for a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
That’s bad advice, and the timing makes it worse. The U.S. has about 4,500 troops left in Afghanistan, which was the number Mr. Trump agreed to earlier this year based on the recommendation by the commander in the field. That’s the minimum required for the mission of supporting Afghan forces against the Taliban, and intelligence and counterterror operations against al Qaeda and Islamic State. 
Mr. Trump is considering a cut to 2,500 troops within weeks, which is better than zero but not much better. That might be sustainable if done in gradual fashion in consultation with allies and the Afghan government. But if it’s rushed to meet Mr. Trump’s political deadline, it will demoralize the Afghans, who are doing the fighting and the dying.
The President is also required by a 2019 bipartisan appropriations bill to certify to Congress that a withdrawal will further “the objective of setting conditions for the long-term defeat of al Qaeda and Islamic State and will not make the United States more vulnerable to terrorist attacks originating from Afghanistan or supported by terrorist elements in Afghanistan.” The conditions for such a certification don’t exist today.
Mr. Trump can take credit for reducing the U.S. footprint and inducing the Taliban to negotiate with the Afghan government. But the Taliban haven’t lived up to their promise to reduce the violence, which is getting worse. If they see Mr. Trump withdraw further, they will have even less incentive to negotiate in good faith. A complete withdrawal all but guarantees a Taliban-ISIS assault on Kabul, and a 1975 Saigon-style defeat and humiliation is possible. That would betray the blood and treasure the U.S. has spent for 19 years.
That can’t be the legacy Mr. Trump wants, and he won’t be able to blame it on his successor if Joe Biden becomes President on Jan. 20. Mr. Trump will have made the fateful decision to abandon the field. American troops in Afghanistan protect U.S. national interests against the revival of a terror sanctuary. The only beneficiaries of a U.S. withdrawal now would be the Taliban, Iran and Islamic terrorists.

2020/11/15,Gavin Newsom’s Covid Laundry,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/gavin-newsoms-covid-laundry-11605482072," California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been caught violating his own social-distancing rules by attending a birthday party at a Napa Valley restaurant with a dozen or so friends—even as some two million in his state are unemployed thanks to his strict virus rules. 
The San Francisco Chronicle reported Friday that on Nov. 6 Mr. Newsom celebrated a political adviser’s 50th birthday with at least a dozen people from more than three households at the famous French Laundry restaurant (typical dinner: $350 excluding wine). 
Last month the Governor issued rules limiting attendance at all private gatherings, even those outdoors, to three households. People were also required to maintain at least six feet of distance from different households at all times. Oh, and no shouting, chanting or singing. Good luck muting the kids at Christmas.
New rules on Friday also say people shouldn’t play loud music or wind instruments indoors, which could potentially spread virus droplets. So Californians will have to celebrate a literal Silent Night this Christmas. 
We don’t know if Mr. Newsom and his friends sang “Happy Birthday,” but his outdoor get-together doesn’t seem especially risky even though it showed poor leadership. The Governor said Friday that while his family “followed the restaurant’s health protocols and took safety precautions, we should have modeled better behavior and not joined the dinner.”
Nobody should begrudge the Governor for celebrating a birthday with friends. The problem is that he and many politicians require the hoi polloi to follow strict virus rules that they don’t abide by themselves. Then they threaten lockdowns as punishment if the little people don’t comply. 
Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser traveled to Delaware to celebrate Joe Biden’s election victory even as she told her residents not to travel to other states. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is saying that people must “cancel traditional Thanksgiving plans,” and invite no guests, even as she joined a street party celebrating Mr. Biden’s apparent victory and spoke with a bullhorn. 
No wonder so many Americans ignore politicians and other elites who lecture them about wearing masks and following Covid-19 rules as a moral duty.

2020/11/15,China Is Losing Its Bet on Chips,Inside View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-is-losing-its-bet-on-chips-11605476356,"Apple is making its first Mac computers since 2005 without an Intel microprocessor. Instead, the company announced last week, Macs will use Apple’s own M1 processor, fabricated by TSMC, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Hey, nothing personal, Intel—by now the whole industry knows you botched your transition to sub-10-nanometer chips and are still behind. But this has implications way beyond computing.
If Intel is a few years behind, China’s lag may be closer to a decade. In conjunction with formulating its 14th Five Year Plan, Beijing put out an official communiqué (I love that word!) previewing its “protracted battle” with the U.S. and stated, “Technology self-reliance is the strategic support for national development.” What’s scary is that China may have to draw this battle line right through Taiwan, where Apple gets its processors. We now see headlines like this in the Asia Times: “US tech giants exposed if China takes Taiwan.” Ya think? Let’s break this down.

To begin, note that last year China produced only 16% of the semiconductors it consumed domestically. In 2014, China announced a National Integrated Circuit Plan promising to spend $150 billion to expand local semiconductor manufacturing. It didn’t work because you can’t throw money at the problem. The world is littered with companies ( AT&T,General Motors ) and countries (France, Italy, Russia) that failed at semiconductor production. It takes state-of-the-art equipment and homegrown expertise.
Second, to produce wicked-fast chips for smartphones, 5G and certainly the latest precision weapons, you need fabrication facilities, or fabs, that can turn out 7- or even 5-nanometer chips, which isn’t easy to do. According to Mike Brown, director of the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit, “50% of advance semiconductor production is in Taiwan.” The rest is in the U.S., South Korea and Israel.
Third, the Trump administration cut off China’s Huawei from buying advanced chips made by TSMC. Except for Intel and Samsung, most everyone uses TSMC, including U.S. companies Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.
Fourth, for about five years, Intel has been stuck at 14-nanometer chips. This gets confusing: I spent most of my early career tracking the chip business, and I still get headaches digging into their guts. What Intel calls 14 nanometers, TSMC calls 10 nanometers. To get to sub-10, you need to use photolithography with extreme ultraviolet light, or EUV, to etch tiny lines onto chips. Intel has said it won’t start producing 10-nanometer chips (the equivalent of TMSC’s 7 nanometers) until late 2021. Intel may even buy chips from TSMC! 
Fifth, China has many partly state-owned semiconductor companies, like the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. , or SMIC, but none have caught up to TSMC because of another four letters, ASML. This is the Dutch equipment company that makes the only EUV photolithography machines. This from ASML: “EUV lithography uses light with a wavelength of just 13.5 nanometers (nearly x-ray level), a reduction of almost 14 times that of the other enabling lithography solution in advanced chipmaking, DUV (deep ultraviolet) lithography, which uses 193-nanometer light.” Oh, and ASML is not allowed to sell to China for defense reasons. So for now, China is locked out of sub-10-nanometer technology. Sure, it could invent its own EUV, but that might take a decade. 
Finally, geopolitics steps in with a lot of what-ifs. If China’s self-reliance initiative fails, and a Biden administration continues an advanced chip embargo—which it should—China would be in a bind, much as the 1941 oil embargo of Japan may have forced its hand. China’s military, in an arms race with the U.S., has to be nervous about being locked out of sub-10-nanometer chips. Beijing is likely gaming out the costs and benefits of bringing Taiwan’s capacity under its control, even as the U.S. weighs defending it: TSMC has five fabs on a single campus, Hsinchu Science Park.
But even that bold step would likely fail almost right away. Unlike an assembly line or an oil refinery, making chips is fickle. The formula might be written down but is really in the head of TSMC’s engineers and is tweaked almost daily. A Silicon Valley engineer once accidentally spilled ink into a fab’s water supply—and output yields went up! A forced Taiwan takeover would crater output even if China brought in mainland engineers. It’s more art than science.
After a forced takeover, the next plausible fear is a few well-placed Chinese missiles taking out half of the world’s advanced chip production, and of course a big chunk of the global economy. But the shock waves from that move would damage China’s economy even more than the pandemic did. Still, I hope TSMC factories are guarded by banks of Patriot missiles. I’d put some of those around ASML’s Dutch facilities too.
It may take a few years, but Intel will catch up. China may too. Meanwhile, it’s smart to diversify where advanced chips are made. The Trump administration got TSMC to agree to build a fab in Arizona, spending $12 billion by 2029. That’s a start.

2020/11/15,Mexico’s Assault on Energy Investors,The Americas,https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexicos-assault-on-energy-investors-11605476282,"When U.S. ratification of President Trump’s reformulated North American Free Trade Agreement was still in doubt, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador put in a good word for it. 
In November 2019 he boasted that he had sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi explaining that approval of the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was “in the interest of the three peoples, the three nations.” 
The U.S. Congress ratified the agreement in December and it went into effect in July. But now AMLO—as the Mexican president is known—wants to treat the USMCA like a buffet, taking for Mexico what he likes but having none of what he doesn’t.

What he likes, he said last week, is that investors now flock to Mexico because “the North American market is assured” and “this means jobs and well-being.” This was a reference to the hundreds of billions of dollars in manufacturing exports and agriculture that now flow north from Mexico, duty-free, every year. 
But in the same remarks AMLO repeated his belief that the agreement doesn’t require an open Mexican energy market because Mexico retains its “exclusive domain” over its resources. 
That’s not how energy investors read the USMCA, and they’ve begun to push back against AMLO’s economic nationalism. In an Oct. 22 letter to Mr. Trump, more than 40 members of the Congress from both sides of the aisle complained that actions taken by AMLO’s government “threaten U.S. energy companies’ investment and market access and undermine the spirit” of the USMCA. A storm is brewing.
Mexico’s 2014 constitutional reform opened the country’s electricity and oil-and-gas markets to nonstate investors—foreign and domestic. Since then private capital has flowed into oil exploration, gasoline and electricity.
But open markets conflict with AMLO’s goal of reviving state-owned oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and the national electricity company, CFE. Neither enterprise is up to the challenge of competition and both are short on capital. 
So to help his national champions, the Mexican president has spent the past two years putting his thumb on the scales in favor of the behemoth state energy companies. This includes everything from slow-walking permits for gasoline stations and refusing nondiscriminatory access to infrastructure to blocking the startup of new power stations and suspending auctions and development on oil and gas fields.
Pemex and CFE continue to flounder. Bloomberg has reported that in the first 21 months of AMLO’s presidency, Pemex gave up some 13% of Mexico’s gasoline market to private concerns, adding that “at the end of August, private companies were supplying about 17.5% of total gasoline volumes” and “approximately 27% of diesel.” In response, the government has begun to move more aggressively in support of its darlings. 
In June Mexico’s competition commission—an independent regulatory body—went to the Supreme Court, alleging that a new federal electricity policy announced in May is anticompetitive because it doesn’t treat CFE’s rivals equally, and that it oversteps executive authority. A high-court stay has been upheld on appeal, pending a ruling on the policy.
This is a rare, and likely temporary, setback for Mr. López Obrador, who has successfully purged most independent institutions and packed them with loyalists. He now controls the energy regulator and the hydrocarbon commission. He successfully got rid of one member of the Supreme Court, which no longer enjoys the prestige of independence. The competition commission remains independent, but it’s an outlier. 
On July 22 Mr. López Obrador reportedly met with some two dozen regulators and officials to present a 17-point plan for saving Pemex and CFE, including a proposal to end new permitting for competitors. The document has since been leaked. AMLO has also said publicly that he is ready to change the constitution to protect state control of energy.
This implies a rollback of Mexico’s 2014 energy reform. By demagoguing economic liberals, he may win popular support for it. But an effort to protect state companies at the expense of private investors would likely contravene Mexico’s USMCA commitments.
The agreement recognizes Mexico as the sole owner of its natural resources. But in matters related to state-owned enterprises, it says Mexico’s laws must remain consistent with obligations it has under already-ratified free-trade agreements. This is a reference to Mexico’s membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which commits signatories to an open market in energy, nondiscrimination in trade and investment, and the prohibition of indirect expropriations. The investor-state dispute-settlement provisions in energy, telecom and infrastructure in Mexico that were in Nafta are retained in the USMCA.
The upshot is that if AMLO wants Mexico’s duty-free access to the U.S. and Canada to remain intact, energy competition will have to become part of his vocabulary.

Correction: An earlier version misstated the date of the July 22 meeting on Pemex.

2020/11/15,It’s Now Up to Governors to Slow the Spread,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-now-up-to-governors-to-slow-the-spread-11605476054,"The latest U.S. Covid surge isn’t confined to certain regions like the ones in the spring and summer. It’s hitting the whole nation hard. Hospitalizations reached 70,000 this week, with more than 13,000 patients in intensive-care units. Health systems in communities like Minot, N.D., and El Paso, Texas, are overburdened, and others may be in the same position soon if governors don’t work quickly and across state lines to slow the spread. 
In previous waves, health-care workers from less-affected areas were deployed to New York and the South. It isn’t possible to send an army of health-care personnel into hot zones when the entire country is a hot zone. Another 15% of the U.S. population could be infected by the end of January, on top of the 15% that has already been infected. The genetic epidemiologist Trevor Bedford estimates that such a course could result in about 200,000 more deaths, assuming an improved infection fatality rate of about 0.45%. 
The Covid response has been a joint effort, with the federal government working to support states overseeing their own local mitigation efforts. But the White House is changing hands during the most critical point of the pandemic, and it’s a particularly important time for leadership from governors, mayors and county administrators. State and local actions, supported by improved treatments, can help build a bridge to vaccinations and more widespread immunity in 2021. Americans are understandably tired of Covid, but accepting temporary restrictions now will help prevent even more painful personal and economic disruptions. 
A patchwork of local policies won’t be potent enough. People move across borders and bring the virus. Governors and local leaders should first reinforce steps known to be effective: wearing a quality mask, avoiding gatherings and maintaining social distance, especially indoors. Halloween gatherings contributed to the current spread, and Thanksgiving will be no different without more vigilance. At least while infections are widespread and surging, governors and local leaders should mandate the use of masks and impose clear and consistent plans to restrict gatherings. They should remind people to avoid large groups at Thanksgiving and stay home if possible.
This doesn’t mean broad lockdowns. State and local leaders can tie restrictions to expected hospital strain, tailored to hot spots and not necessarily the entire state. Restrictions can focus on known sources of spread, such as bars and nightclubs. 
Congress should help by supporting affected businesses with another round of paycheck protection. A priority should be helping schools that are open, especially elementary schools, where the risk of infection is lower and the benefits of in-class instruction are considerable.
Governors should also work with local leaders to use new countermeasures that have only recently become available. This includes a valuable new treatment: monoclonal antibodies, man-made versions of naturally occurring ones that neutralize the virus. But these drugs are challenging to administer, requiring special sites for infusions and public education. People in high-risk groups with symptoms should get tested and treated before their condition deteriorates. Governors need to get the message out that Covid is now a treatable condition at the early stages, and work with local leaders to ensure that access to antibodies is available, especially in underserved communities.
Rapid testing is also more widely available, which allows for better detection of outbreaks in settings where people must be together, such as assisted-living facilities, essential workplaces and schools. With so much coronavirus spread through people without symptoms, especially younger people, it’s now possible to consider using these tests routinely as one more tool. Governors can work together to develop a consistent national screening protocol for containing outbreaks.
Winter was always going to be the hardest time with the virus, but coordinated state and local leadership can make it more manageable. Many governors have taken aggressive steps to slow the spread, but states that don’t act quickly put the entire nation at risk.

2020/11/15,Let the Transition Proceed,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/let-the-transition-proceed-11605475975,"The more divisive our politics, the more important it is to respect the fundamentals of constitutional democracy. Two tenets are critical: elections in which legal votes are counted honestly and the peaceful transition of power. It is appropriate to pose legal challenges to an election’s integrity, but not to impede the transition.
Two weeks after Election Day, President Trump’s team hasn’t presented compelling evidence against Joe Biden’s victory. They are assembling that evidence and Mr. Trump says he sees a path to victory, but there is no reason to delay the procedures for transferring power to a potential Biden administration.
The main reason to facilitate the transition is to show that amid deep political division, we can rely on constitutional norms, procedures and institutions. The Trump campaign has every right to litigate evidence of fraud, malfeasance or error. We should care about that evidence, even if it doesn’t change the outcome, because it undermines the honest elections on which democracy depends. Anyone who corrupts them should face serious prison time. It’s far more serious than bribing your kid’s way into college.
Mr. Trump and his supporters have every reason to ridicule the Democrats’ hypocrisy about the peaceful transition of power. The Obama administration lied to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, spied on Mr. Trump’s candidacy and transition, and desperately tried to cover its tracks. The Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton’s campaign commissioned the false Steele dossier and funneled it into a receptive Federal Bureau of Investigation, launching a series of investigations that hobbled the Trump presidency. Barack Obama’s administration launched a baseless crusade against Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Flynn, for making a perfectly legitimate phone call to Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. Holdover officials from the Obama administration did all they could to impede the new administration, including leaks of classified information about its actions.
It is an outrage that, four years later, we haven’t had a full accounting of this malfeasance. This delay is all the more noxious because the party that engineered these abuses is now returning to power. It is reasonable to fear that if Democrats retake control of the Justice Department, they will be less than zealous in pursuing these crimes.
But the Democrats’ corruption of the last transition doesn’t justify the Republicans’ corrupting this one. With the country so angry, divided and suspicious, it is vital that the incumbent administration do everything it can to assist the potential winners in case they prevail, as seems likely. While the Trump campaign presents its evidence in court and watches the recount in Georgia, it should give the Biden transition team the office space it needs, begin briefing its national security team, and provide assistance to ensure a smooth handover. This demonstration of good faith is less a legal requirement than a constitutional norm. Reasserting it now would strengthen our strained public institutions. They need it more than ever.

2020/11/15,Does the ACLU Want to Ban My Book?,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-the-aclu-want-to-ban-my-book-11605475898,"I never thought book banning would be respectable in America, much less that I’d be the target, but here we are. Last Thursday Target stopped selling my book, “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,” in response to two Twitter complaints. 
One read: “In 2016, @Target, you released a statement affirming your support for transgender customers. @AskTarget why you’re selling a book notorious for its harmful rhetoric against us. Historically, harmful products have been pulled from this shelf, and this should be, too.” 
The other: “I think the transcommunity deserves a response from @AskTarget @Target as to why they’re selling this book about ‘the transgender epidemic sweeping the country.’ ”
That’s a caricature of my view. I think mature adults should have the freedom to undergo medical transition. But teenagers are another matter. Social contagions exist, and teen girls are particularly susceptible to them. The book takes a hard look at whether the sudden spike in transgender identification among teen girls is yet another social contagion to befall girls who, in another era, might have fallen prey to anorexia or bulimia. 
Many transgender adults, including some I interviewed for the book, agree that teen girls are undergoing medical transition too fast with too little oversight. Others disagree and have written books. Amid a sea of material unskeptically promoting medical transition for teenage girls, there’s one book that investigates this phenomenon and urges caution. That is the book the activists seek to suppress.
“ Abigail Shrier’s book is a dangerous polemic with a goal of making people not trans,” Chase Strangio, the American Civil Liberties Union’s deputy director for transgender justice, tweeted Friday. “I think of all the times & ways I was told my transness wasn’t real & the daily toll it takes. We have to fight these ideas which are leading to the criminalization of trans life again.” Then: “Stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100% a hill I will die on.”
You read that right: Some in today’s ACLU favor book banning. Grace Lavery, a professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley, went further, tweeting: “I DO encourage followers to steal Abigail Shrier’s book and burn it on a pyre.”
This is where leftist extremism, encouraged by cowardly corporations, leads. The market—that is, readers—should determine what booksellers carry. My book was consistently No. 1 in several categories on Amazon based on sales. But the online giant, under pressure from extremists, refused to allow my publisher to advertise “Irreversible Damage” on the site. 
At a time when independent bookstores are nearly extinct, chain bookstores are endangered, and Americans’ movement outside their homes is constrained by a pandemic, a handful of online retailers have outsize influence over the ideas to which we have access. And those ideas are being winnowed in one direction. 
Robin DiAngelo’s book, “White Fragility,” which falsely accuses millions of Americans of being inalterably racist, is for sale at Target.com, no matter how many Americans it might offend. It should be. The notion that civil society required a marketplace of ideas was something liberals once believed—especially those who worked at the ACLU, or taught at Berkeley. 
In response to media attention and customer complaints, Target reversed itself; my book is again for sale. But other books will be quietly suppressed. In an America where the left has achieved dominance of cultural institutions and adopted a tyrannical opposition to other ideas, where social media extends its reach, and where books are distributed by a handful of retailers—a book burning doesn’t even require a populist uprising. It takes only one online extremist or two to make a book disappear. And when that happens, don’t look to the ACLU to defend you.

2020/11/15,"California, Love It and Leave It",Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-love-it-and-leave-it-11605472619,"Austin, Texas
I love California, but I had to leave. I grew up in Fremont, attended Stanford, and have spent most of my adult life in the San Francisco Bay Area, founding technology companies like Palantir and Addepar and investing in many others. In 2011 I founded 8VC, a venture-capital firm that today manages more than $3.6 billion in committed capital. Few top venture capitalists consider living anywhere other than California and a handful of global financial centers, but I am moving myself and dozens of my 8VC colleagues to a new land of opportunity: Texas.
The harsh truth is that California has fallen into disrepair. Bad policies discourage business and innovation, stifle opportunity and make life in major cities ugly and unpleasant. 
Forty years ago my parents came to California because you could accomplish anything in the Golden State. Government policy facilitated the entrepreneurial spirit. Dreamers and doers could thrive. The burst of activity in tech, finance, medicine, energy and many other industries lasted for decades. But now a state like Texas provides these opportunities without the problems and baggage California has accumulated. Let me mention a few personal examples: 
• Public safety. Ill-conceived criminal-justice reforms and radical district attorneys are taking a toll on urban life. Three of my colleagues’ wives have been harassed and chased by derelicts in San Francisco’s streets, which are littered with needles and human waste. My wife is afraid to walk around the city with our young daughters. Police often don’t even respond to harassment and property crime, which has surged; San Francisco’s property-crime rate is now the nation’s highest.
• Electricity. The wildfire smoke that has blanketed California cities is one thing. But power outages, which left us stressed about spoiling breast milk for our daughter, are the direct result of California government incompetence. Last year the state had 25,000 blackouts, and this year has been even worse. The electricity turns on and off, as in Third World countries. Meanwhile, Texas has its own energy grid, with a plentiful and diverse supply. It’s nice to turn on the lights whenever we want.
• Responsiveness. In the early days of the pandemic in March, 8VC entreated the mayor of San Francisco and city staff to clarify rules to allow our critical employees to work on accelerating Covid-19 testing and the development of therapeutics. The city didn’t deign to respond. Government officials in Texas, by contrast, care about business. They return calls.
• Housing. California’s restrictive zoning laws make it nearly impossible for many essential low- and middle-income workers to live anywhere near major cities. In Texas, permissive zoning allows every member of our staff to live close to work and spend time with friends and family instead of enduring grueling commutes.
That’s not all. The California government is beholden to public-employee unions and spending is out of control. A broken environmental review process means it takes a decade of paying lawyers to build anything. Legislation makes it impossible for businesses to hire contractors without an exemption—granted by friends in the legislature, as with the music industry, or won by spending hundreds of millions on a referendum, as gig-economy companies with drivers just did. This isn’t how business is done in developed countries.
Politics in the state is in many ways closed off to different ideas. We grew weary of California’s intolerant far left, which would rather demonize opponents than discuss honest differences of opinion.
I will continue investing in Silicon Valley startups and fighting to help the state. I’m optimistic that over the long run, California can return to the values that once made it the dynamic center of global technology entrepreneurship. But until priorities change, the state will keep losing its top builders and creators. 
In 2000 or 2010, it made sense to build in San Francisco. That’s where all the talent was, but not anymore. Except for a few concentrated parts of advanced biotech and software infrastructure technology, talented people are building top technology firms all over the country. This disaggregation of talent will spread prosperity across the U.S. Some of my most prolific entrepreneurial friends from California have moved with us here to Texas. Others have left for Miami, Nashville, Las Vegas and other great American cities. Six of our portfolio companies are already based in Austin and employ hundreds of people.
Our investments follow the talent. We’re betting that the future of America is going to be built in the middle of the country, in places with good government and a reasonable cost of living. In other words, places like Texas.
My firm has a motto: “The world is broken, let’s fix it.” We invest in technologies and people who will transform major industries and improve the lives of millions. It’s tragic that California is no longer hospitable to that mission, but beautiful that Texas is. Our job as entrepreneurs and investors is to build the future, and I know of no better place to do so than Texas.

2020/11/15,When Nixon Taped Joe Biden,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-nixon-taped-joe-biden-11605472525,"Joe Biden can be heard on the Nixon tapes. President Nixon called Mr. Biden on Tuesday, Dec. 19, 1972. The president had returned from Camp David, where he had been planning an ambitious second-term government reorganization. Delaware’s Sen.-elect Biden had narrowly defeated a popular incumbent and Nixon ally, Caleb Boggs, 13 days before his 30th birthday. He became the second-youngest person ever elected to the Senate. 
Nixon—who won Delaware by more than 20 points in his 49-state landslide—took note of this rising star, who had flipped a GOP Senate seat. “If I had gone to Delaware, it wouldn’t have changed one iota,” Nixon said to Chuck Colson about Boggs’s defeat. “He just had a damn good young candidate running against him.”
On Dec. 19, Nixon saw in his morning news summary that Mr. Biden’s wife, Neilia, and 1-year-old daughter, Naomi, had been killed in a car accident the day before in Delaware. Their sons, 3-year-old Beau and 2-year-old Hunter, survived the crash with severe injuries. Nixon, who as a child lost two siblings to tuberculosis, wanted to call. “Could you get the new senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, on the phone please?” he asked the White House switchboard operator. 
Nixon and Mr. Biden were both from hardscrabble families. They had irascible fathers who taught them how to pick themselves up after a defeat. Both were self-conscious that they didn’t attend the best schools. They had an interest in foreign affairs. Like Nixon, Mr. Biden later served as vice president under a more charismatic president. They were never part of the in-crowd; that drove them to work harder. 
News of the crash momentarily stopped political talk in the Oval Office. “He wasn’t in the car?” Nixon asked. “No, sir,” one aide, Ken Cole, said, “He was up on the Hill.”
It was a moment that brought two men together who might otherwise never have connected in a personal way. “Hello, Mr. President, how are you?” Mr. Biden answered. Even senators don’t forget their first phone call from a president. “Senator, I know this is a very tragic day for you,” Nixon said, seemingly searching for words, “but I wanted you to know that all of us here at the White House were thinking about you, and praying for you and also for your two children.” 
“I appreciate that very much,” Mr. Biden responded. Nixon, about the same age as the senator-elect’s father, urged him to pick himself up after the greatest setback of his life. “You have the great fortune of being young,” Nixon said. “I remember I was two years older than you when I went to the House. But the main point is you can remember that she was there when you won a great victory, and you enjoyed it together. And now I’m sure that she’ll be watching you from now on. Good luck to you.”
Nixon, who recognized Donald Trump’s potential in 1987, saw Mr. Biden’s 15 years earlier. “I appreciate it very much, Mr. President,” Mr. Biden responded. “I appreciate your call. I appreciate it.”

2020/11/15,Biden Will Benefit From Trump’s Covid Work,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-will-benefit-from-trumps-covid-work-11605471960,"Holman Jenkins contends that “It’s Biden’s Virus Now” (Business World, Nov. 11). From a policy standpoint, Mr. Jenkins is correct: Come January, it will be up to the Biden administration to eradicate, or at least manage, the coronavirus, a task that will doubtless be aided by the vaccines developed under President Trump’s unacknowledged Operation Warp Speed.
From a political standpoint, however, Mr. Jenkins couldn’t be more wrong—this will never be “Biden’s virus.” To the extent that Joe Biden’s administration fails in its struggle against the pandemic, Covid will remain President Trump’s virus and the Biden failure will be blamed on President Trump’s letting the virus get out of control. On the other hand, to the extent that the new administration succeeds in its efforts against the coronavirus, the result will be portrayed as the enlightened Biden team’s triumph over the former administration’s incompetence and “denial of science” in the face of the Trump virus.
Most of us don’t care who gets the credit, we just want the Covid situation ameliorated so we can get back to normal. But in Washington, where politics is everything, this will never be Biden’s virus, it will always be Mr. Trump’s virus and hence a win/win for Mr. Biden.

Mr. Jenkins nails it about the number and importance of undetected Covid cases. The CDC in June confirmed that undetected Covid cases are about 10 times greater than detected cases. Given our 10 million detected cases and adding ten times that for undetected cases, our likely immunity is 110 million people. Add this to another 50 million that develop an immunity by next May plus 70 million vaccinations by then and we’re at the level needed for herd immunity according to “Nature Communications.” 
Herd immunity is the only way to stop a virus. Fortunately, better treatments have significantly reduced the death rate. With Operation Warp Speed vaccines we may get there even sooner.

2020/11/15,A Short History of Congressional Obstruction,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-short-history-of-congressional-obstruction-11605471779,"William Galston sets forth policy issues in “Where Biden and McConnell Can Agree” (Politics & Ideas, Nov. 11) assuming that Republicans maintain a Senate majority and GOP votes are needed to advance Joe Biden’s agenda. Mr. Galston warns that if Sen. Mitch McConnell fails to compromise, he “risks opening his party to charges of obstructionism—and losing the support of moderate and independent voters who deserted Mr. Trump.”
Republicans in Congress have been typecast by news media as obstructionists since Ronald Reagan was president. For a half-century before the Reagan years, the GOP had so little power in Congress that obstruction was rarely an option. The narrative for the last four decades is that Republicans are born obstructionists, while Democrats are innately prone to compromise and forward progress. Democrats spent the last four years, especially the last two, doing everything in their power to obstruct GOP initiatives, but most journalists reported that just-say-no Sen. McConnell and obstinate President Trump stood in the way of legislative achievements. Consider, though, the stimulus package that was stalled in Congress before the election. Republicans offered a $500 million package, eventually upping it to $1.8 trillion. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to budge on a $2.2 trillion spending demand. Was 82% of a GOP stimulus loaf in October not better than no loaf at all? Were Democrats blamed by reporters for being obstructionists? Of course not; ornery Sen. McConnell was the culprit.
The only way for Republicans to dodge the obstructionist label is to become Democrats.

2020/11/15,Philadelphia Puts an Ideology Ahead of Kids,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/philadelphia-puts-an-ideology-ahead-of-kids-11605471625,"Philadelphia’s banning of Catholic Social Services’ foster care and adoption services isn’t antireligious cruelty, it is antichild cruelty (“Philadelphia’s Antireligious Cruelty” by Thomas Paul, Houses of Worship, Nov. 6). The longstanding legal standard for foster-care placement and adoption has always been “the best interests of the child.” Philadelphia and other jurisdictions have turned this legal standard on its head to promote other values. The only criteria for the placement of children should be a stable home in which the child has the best chance of thriving. As Mr. Paul rightly points out, there are plenty of agencies willing to place children in alternative-lifestyle homes.
If Catholic Social Services provides good, stable homes for children in which they can thrive, that should be the only criterion. If same-sex couples can fulfill this responsibility as well as heterosexual couples, that doesn’t mandate that any given child be placed with such a couple or a same-sex-oriented individual. They may be candidates to serve as foster parents, but no one has a legal right to have a child placed in his, her or their home. Children shouldn’t be used as pawns toward serving subordinate objectives.
Society has taken a step forward in attempting to eradicate discrimination against and the persecution of individuals with a same-sex orientation by protecting their legal rights and affirming their human dignity. Philadelphia has taken two steps backward by confusing that goal with acting in the best interests of children.

2020/11/15,The World Bank Should Lead in Debt Relief,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-bank-should-lead-in-debt-relief-11605471524,"There was a stark omission in David Malpass’s “To Cope With Covid, the World’s Poor Need Debt Relief” (op-ed, Nov. 5). While he is right in his argument that the world’s poorest countries urgently need debt relief from creditors, it was stunning to see Mr. Malpass fail to include the World Bank as a creditor. Between now and the end of 2021, the world’s poorest countries will owe $18.2 billion to the multilateral banks including the World Bank and IMF. The aftershocks of Covid-19 have been devastating for many African countries who are being forced to make impossible choices over whether to pay off debt or invest in fighting the pandemic and stabilizing their economies. As president of the World Bank, Mr. Malpass rightly advocates that the G-20 must do more on debt relief, but the World Bank has yet to take any steps to suspend debt-service payments. By the World Bank’s own estimates, the pandemic could result in 150 million more people falling into extreme poverty. Mr. Malpass knows that debt service relief is a vital tool to help stem the pandemic’s impact, but the bank still hasn’t used it.

While this had been evident for some time, it needed the Covid-19 pandemic’s impact on state and city finances to finally show that these benefits offered to public-sector members are no longer sustainable.
More than a generation ago the private sector, for the most part, decided to curtail such largess for its employees, as well as to replace defined-benefit pension plans with those based on defined contributions. As painful as it was at the time, the private workforce has learned to adapt to the new benefits landscape.
Now it is time for the public sector to catch up with economic reality.

2020/11/16,Trump’s Afghan Adios,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-afghan-sign-off-11605568596,"Pentagon officials on Monday confirmed our report Sunday night that President Trump is expected to order another troop reduction in Afghanistan—with a deadline conveniently timed just before he is likely to leave office on Jan. 20. We wish there was some justification other than the looming end of his Presidency.
There’s certainly no military rationale for reducing U.S. forces to 2,500. The current 4,500 level was recommended earlier this year by Army Gen. Scott Miller, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, when Mr. Trump demanded a reduction from 8,000. The 2,500 looks like a number pulled out of a Pentagon helmet as an arbitrary alternative to the disastrous total pullout Mr. Trump was contemplating last week. 
The smaller force by Jan. 15 means something will have to give in the U.S. mission that includes support for Afghan forces, coordinating the use of air power, intelligence gathering, and counterterror operations against al Qaeda and Islamic State. At some point, low troop levels become a risk to U.S. soldiers because they can’t supply adequate force protection. 
Mr. Trump says it’s time to go because we’ve been there 19 years, and that’s enough. But that’s a political notion put into his head by the loyalists he has placed in charge of the Pentagon in the last few days. The rushed reduction in forces will reinforce the Taliban’s view that they needn’t compromise in negotiations with the Afghan government because the Americans are desperate to depart. 
A clear-eyed view of the stakes came Monday on the Senate floor from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “A rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan now would hurt our allies and delight the people who wish us harm. Violence affecting Afghans is still rampant. The Taliban is not abiding by the conditions of the so-called peace deal,” Mr. McConnell said. “The consequences of a premature American exit would likely be even worse than President Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, which fueled the rise of ISIS and a new round of global terrorism. It would be reminiscent of the humiliating American departure from Saigon in 1975.”
The Republican leader added: “We’d be abandoning our partners in Afghanistan, the brave Afghans who are fighting the terrorists and destroying the government’s leverage in their talks with the Taliban to end the fighting. Our retreat would embolden the Taliban, especially the deadly Haqqani wing, and risk plunging Afghan women and girls back into what they experienced in the 1990s. It would hand a weakened and scattered al Qaeda a big propaganda victory and a renewed safe haven for plotting attacks against America. And it would be welcome news to Iran, which has long provided arms and support to the Taliban and explicitly seeks our retreat from the Middle East.”
Joe Biden’s advisers have said they favor keeping a residual force in Afghanistan, but they can’t know how many troops that requires until they consult with Gen. Miller and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley. Let’s hope the generals can follow Mr. Trump’s misguided orders in a way that offers Mr. Biden more options than retreat after he’s in the White House.

2020/11/16,"Trump, Biden and Covid Vaccines",Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-biden-and-covid-vaccines-11605568709,"For the second Monday in a row, there was good news on the Covid-19 vaccine front. Moderna said its vaccine candidate showed positive results at 95% after Pfizer reported 90% effectiveness. The fight against Covid is far from over, but markets are cheering the vaccines and a promising new Eli Lilly therapy.
Credit here goes to private drug investment and innovation, but also to the Trump Administration for speeding up government approvals. The Administration pushed reforms in the Food and Drug Administration’s bureaucratic and risk-averse culture, even if it didn’t always succeed. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb put a particular priority on speeding up drug approvals. New generic approvals increased to 107 last year from 73 in 2016.
The FDA has also fast-tracked reviews of breakthrough medicines such as gene therapies and let drug makers use creative and adaptive trial designs that aren’t the double-blind randomized control placebo “gold standard.” From 2017 to 2019, an average of 51 novel therapies were approved compared to 32 on average from 2010 to 2016. All of this has been especially helpful on Covid.
Not everyone approves. Some self-styled experts grouse that the FDA is approving too many expensive new drugs that may help only a subset of patients. Their odd logic is that if everyone doesn’t receive a benefit from a drug, then no one should. They say testimonials from doctors are biased and should be ignored.
This summer the FDA was criticized for granting an emergency use authorization (EUA) for convalescent plasma to treat Covid. More than a dozen non-gold standard studies showed benefits. A Mayo Clinic trial that enrolled some 35,000 patients found seven-day mortality was 44% lower among non-intubated patients under the age of 80 who were treated within 72 hours of diagnosis with plasma containing high levels of antibodies versus lower levels. 
The study didn’t find a difference in survival among all patients and didn’t include a placebo group. “There are currently no data from well-controlled, adequately powered randomized clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19,” a National Institutes of Health panel cavilled.
Yet gold-standard trials can obscure critical benefits among subgroups. Consider a World Health Organization multinational trial, which last month reported no benefit from four antiviral drugs tested including Gilead’s remdesivir. An earlier NIH trial in the U.S. found remdesivir improved recovery time by five days and survival by 27%.
The WHO, however, aggregated data from countries with vastly different medical standards, patient populations and risk factors. More than three-quarters of patients were treated in developing countries including Pakistan, Albania, South Africa and Lebanon. Many weren’t treated until late in the disease when antivirals are unlikely to help.
Yet now some critics claim that the FDA jumped the gun by approving remdesivir and should have waited for supposedly more robust evidence like the WHO trial. Some also say the FDA should have consulted outside experts before granting emergency authorization. These panels are notorious for nitpicking trial designs and shooting down promising therapies that only benefit a subgroup of patients. They allow the FDA to disperse accountability for decision-making. Pressure is now building on the FDA to revoke the remdesivir approval and, barring that, for the feds to cut reimbursement for the drug.
Some critics of the Trump FDA’s accelerated approvals are on Mr. Biden’s Covid task force. Take Ezekiel Emanuel, who helped inspire ObamaCare’s bureaucratic panel for cutting Medicare spending, which Congress has since repealed. He believes government needs to clamp down on doctors who prescribe treatments that incrementally help patients, especially the elderly with fewer years to live. 
Then there’s David Kessler, the FDA commissioner in the George H.W. Bush and Clinton Administrations. Mr. Kessler let the agency be hijacked by trial lawyers and banned most silicone breast implants because of unascertainable risks, which many women said they were willing to bear. During his tenure, approvals of new medical devices ground to a halt.
One of the big jobs of “the FDA commissioner is to put their body on the line in between all the forces that want to influence the agency,” Mr. Kessler told Politico in August. What he meant is the agency should ignore doctors and patients who want access to therapies that don’t pass this “expert” bureaucratic obstacle course.
The Trump FDA’s Covid innovation has been providing real-time feedback and clear guidance to drug and vaccine makers about its expectations. This has helped therapies and vaccines advance and cut Phase 3 trials from three years to a few months. These reforms are one of the success stories of the federal Covid response. But there’s a serious risk that the Biden team will default to their instincts and reimpose a culture of bureaucratic control that restricts new medical advances.

2020/11/16,State Tax Revenue Rebound,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-tax-revenue-rebound-11605568517,"In case you hadn’t heard, states are experiencing a surge—of tax revenue. Politicians don’t want this good news to get out because they want more money from Congress.
California recently reported that tax revenue for this fiscal year is running $9.9 billion (18.6%) above projections. Personal income tax revenue in October was $1 billion (15.6%) higher than in the previous October, and sales taxes were up 9.2%. For the last four months, overall revenue has exceeded spring forecasts and even 2019 collections.
Behold how a rising stock market lifts progressive state budgets. The top 1% of earners in California generate half of its personal income tax revenue. A rebounding stock market—the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased 16% since the beginning of July—has produced a gusher of revenue for blue states with sharply progressive tax systems.
In New York, overall tax revenue was up 4.3% in September compared to September 2019 thanks to soaring personal income tax revenue. Most of this bump appears due to an increase in withholdings from larger unemployment checks. 
Like many states, New York taxes unemployment benefits. Because the federal $600 in weekly enhanced jobless benefits more than offset wage losses for most unemployed workers, many states have been collecting more income tax revenue from workers who are unemployed than from lower-income folks who are working. After enhanced benefits lapsed in October, income tax revenues in New York dipped though were still only 1.8% lower than last year. 
Personal income tax revenue in Connecticut increased 2.9% in September from the previous year. In the fiscal year that started in July, income tax receipts are running 0.3% ahead of last year and sales tax revenue is up 5.3%. 
Sales tax revenue in most states hasn’t fallen as much as expected because many Americans haven’t reduced spending. They are spending on different things. They are buying more appliances to remodel their homes while spending less on personal services like hair cuts and dry-cleaning, which most states don’t tax.
Despite the wailing by Democratic governors, budgets in states run by Republicans have been hit harder by the pandemic because they rely less on income taxes from the wealthy, which have been buoyant. Tax collections in Texas were down 8.25% in September and October from the previous year due mainly to lower oil and gas revenues. But Gov. Greg Abbott isn’t begging for a federal bailout. 
Most states will survive the pandemic fine without more federal aid if they don’t reimpose lockdowns as Oregon, Michigan and New Mexico have, though some have pre-existing problems that Democrats want Congress to relieve. Most blue-state budget bruises are self-inflicted.

2020/11/16,Turkey’s Problem Banks,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkeys-problem-banks-11605568463,"After years of economic mismanagement, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this month replaced his central bank governor and finance minister—and promised change. Turkey needs better economic policy, but Mr. Erdogan’s political control will undermine domestic reform.
Consider the story of Halkbank, Turkey’s second largest state-owned lender. The bank allegedly ran a long-time $20 billion scheme to avoid U.S. sanctions against Iran. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have been investigating the case for years and charged several Turkish officials. A key witness accused Mr. Erdogan of personally approving the sanctions busting, though he and the bank have denied wrongdoing.
Mr. Erdogan reportedly pressured President Trump to drop the case and grant immunity to those involved, but in October 2019 federal prosecutors charged the bank “with fraud, money laundering, and sanctions offenses.” Last month a federal judge declined to dismiss the case.
A verdict could come in 2021 or 2022, and Mr. Erdogan is likely to pressure Joe Biden in the interim. We trust the new President would make clear that American courts are independent. If the U.S. fines the bank for the amount it allegedly helped launder, that could mark the end of the lender.
Separately last month, a U.S. federal judge ruled that a case can proceed against Kuveyt Turk bank, which allegedly aided the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas. The surviving children of Eitam and Naama Henkin, who died in a Hamas attack five years ago, are not American citizens. But the judge ruled they can sue Kuveyt Turk in an American court under the Justice for United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act. Countless others who have suffered at the hands of groups like Hamas have taken note of this ruling, and Turkey’s notoriously permissive banks could become besieged with lawsuits.
While Turkey had a relatively strong pre-pandemic export market, the official unemployment rate remains above 13%. The country’s previous economic success came from earlier economic reforms and a credit boom. But as Mr. Erdogan’s tenure in office has increased, so has his desire for control of economic decisions. He has embraced the strange idea that interest rate increases drive inflation, and no institution is truly independent in Turkey.
A rate hike could shore up the lira, which had fallen some 30% against the dollar this year before the economic shake up was announced. But Turkish economic policy is still driven primarily by Mr. Erdogan’s short-term political interests, which don’t always align with the nation’s broader priorities.
Mr. Erdogan’s increasingly erratic and aggressive foreign policy doesn’t help. Deeper economic ties with the European Union are critical to the country’s future but difficult to imagine. Ankara nearly provoked a war in the Eastern Mediterranean this summer over contested maritime claims with EU members Cyprus and Greece. After purchasing Russia’s S-400 missile system, the country could be punished with sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. Mr. Trump hasn’t acted, but Mr. Biden could. 
All of this is making investors wary of getting involved in such an unpredictable country. Mr. Erdogan has promised to “swallow a bitter pill” and move the economy forward, but there’s plenty of reason for skepticism.

2020/11/16,The Education of Joe Biden,Main Street,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-education-of-joe-biden-11605568358,"You might not know it today, but for much of his life Joe Biden was friendly to real, if modest, education reform. As a senator, he supported holding states and schools accountable for their students’ performance, expanding public-school choice and increasing federal funding for charter schools and their facilities. In 1997, he even gave a floor speech in which he said that the plight of children “presently caught in a failed public school” was leading him to reconsider his votes against private-school vouchers. As Barack Obama’s vice president, he loyally promoted an agenda that pushed teacher evaluations and charters.
All that went out the window when Mr. Biden entered the 2020 race. During his campaign, he promised to appoint a teacher as education secretary. Now the talk is that Mr. Biden will appoint not only a teacher but the head of a teachers union. The two names most often mentioned are American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and former National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen García. 
Everyone has understood that a Biden Education Department would mark a change of direction from the past four years. But to elevate to education secretary someone whose career has been spent fighting any reform aimed at relaxing the teachers unions’ stranglehold on the public schools would be an astonishingly bleak admission about whose interests come first.
“Appointing either Weingarten or García would be the biggest union payback since Jimmy Carter created the Department of Education in 1979,” says Jeanne Allen, who is founder and CEO of the Center for Education Reform and worked in the Reagan Education Department. “It’s a sign that the teachers unions now own him lock, stock and barrel.”
Ms. Allen is alluding to the Education Department’s origins in the 1976 presidential campaign. That year, the NEA endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time—Mr. Carter. Three years later, he returned the favor by signing the new cabinet-level department into law.
Not everyone was on board. While the NEA was enthusiastic, the AFT was not. Even the New York Times objected. In a May 22, 1979, editorial headlined “Centralizing Education Is No Reform,” the Times explained that the NEA understandably supported the move because it expected the new federal department to “concentrate on the protection of its interests.” 
Those interests were one thing in 1979. They are altogether another today, especially in the thick of a pandemic that has exposed to millions of moms and dads how little the best interests of their children align with those of the teachers unions. Not to mention how few options that leaves them when, say, their kids can’t go to school and they can’t go to work because the teachers unions have succeeded in keeping classrooms closed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been clear on this. “Of key significance,” it advises, “in-person learning is in the best interest of students, when compared to virtual learning.” The CDC has further laid out guidelines for how schools can reopen safely. Instead of cooperating, however, the teachers unions have largely held students hostage to their demands. 

Take the District of Columbia. Resistance from the teachers union forced the schools chancellor to scrap a plan that would have brought about 7,000 kids back for limited in-person learning starting Nov. 9. These were among the most at-risk students in Washington’s school system: Those who are homeless, have special needs or take English as a second language were to be given priority. The Washington Post dryly noted that the president of the Washington Teachers Union characterized the cancellation as a “win.”
The teachers unions generally justify closures on health grounds, claiming they are necessary to protect teachers and staff from Covid-19. But they have been embarrassed that private and parochial schools have managed, often working with a far smaller staff and less resources, to resume classroom instruction while keeping the coronavirus at bay.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker points to the state’s Catholic schools. They have had about 28,000 students and 4,000 employees back in their schools since mid-August, with only a handful of Covid cases. Others, including the CDC, have noted that school closures set back learning, with the most disadvantaged students falling furthest behind. In short, there is nothing progressive about keeping kids from their classrooms.
Ms. García or Ms. Weingarten might find it hard going in a Senate run by Mitch McConnell, but presidents enjoy a presumptive right to name their own advisers. If either of these women were to be confirmed, it would be a tremendous victory for the unions. And as departing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos put it in a recent tweet, “When unions win, kids lose.”
Is this really the signal Mr. Biden wishes to send by turning federal education policy over to a teachers union president?

2020/11/16,‘Tribalism’ Isn’t Going Anywhere,Global View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/tribalism-isnt-going-anywhere-11605568195,"Azerbaijan and Armenia may have signed a peace deal, but a new conflict is brewing in Ethiopia that is potentially more devastating, strategically consequential and historically important. The Caucasian war looked backward to the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Ottoman Empire’s genocidal demise. The Ethiopian war looks forward, as the sort of national conflict that dominated the past two centuries of European history begins to shape the politics of a rising Africa. 
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, has sent in the army to force the restive northeastern Tigray region back into line. In September, local authorities in Tigray defied a nationwide ban on elections (ostensibly due to the Covid pandemic but seen by Mr. Ahmed’s opponents as a ploy to retain his power) to vote for a new provincial assembly. Though the Tigrayans only numbered 8.8 million by the last Ethiopian census in 2007, this relatively small ethnic group has played an outsize role in the country’s politics since it led a military campaign that overthrew the Marxist regime of President Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991.

What many Ethiopians from other ethnic groups considered a form of Tigrayan domination took the form of a dictatorial government. Mr. Ahmed dismantled that dictatorship, to local and international applause. Many Tigrayans, however, resent the new system and believe that they are being targeted for unfair dismissals and prosecutions. Their current defiance of central authority is seen by many Ethiopians as part of a plan to reassert their power beyond their home region.
Neighboring Eritrea, which won its independence in 1993, has already been drawn into the conflict, with Tigray firing missiles at its capital, and the entire Horn of Africa could be thrown into chaos if the fighting persists. Sudan’s fragile domestic order could easily be destabilized by a war next door that disrupts trade, creates flows of refugees, and draws Sudanese ethnic groups into the conflict. Somalia, still in turmoil amid the fight against Al Shabab terrorists, depends on Ethiopian troops and political support that would be at risk if the fighting continues. And Ethiopia itself, with roughly 110 million people divided into approximately 80 ethnicities speaking almost 90 languages, is a tinderbox. As my Hudson Institute colleague James Barnett noted in a recent report, prolonged fighting in the north could lead to more challenges against the central government and, in a worst-case scenario, a Yugoslav-style meltdown on a much greater scale. 
For students of world politics, the Ethiopian conflict holds two vital lessons. The first is an important reminder that much of the conventional wisdom in the West about geopolitical developments in the rest of the world is firmly embedded in a mix of ignorance, wishful thinking and projection. Mr. Ahmed, like former rock stars of the global do-gooding circuit Aung San Suu Kyi and Paul Kagame, has never been the figure his Western admirers imagined. He emerged from a career in the Ethiopian intelligence service, and his vision of his role and the future of his country has little to do with the fantasies of his foreign admirers. Myanmar’s Ms. Suu Kyi, Rwanda’s Mr. Kagame and Mr. Ahmed are complex figures in countries where the rules are weak, the stakes are existential, and scruples are necessarily few. The inane rituals of celebration and reprobation that self-described moral leaders in the West alternately inflict on these leaders are noise, not signal. Serious people need to tune it out. 
The second lesson is even more important. When it comes to sub-Saharan Africa and other places undergoing rapid economic development and social change, Western thinkers need a paradigm shift. Since the end of colonial rule, many Western observers have naively assumed that ethnic and religious tensions would fade away with economic development. 
That is not how things work. During the past 20 years, Ethiopia has consistently posted some of the best growth rates in Africa, but ethnic tensions have risen with gross domestic product. Illiterate peasants scratching a bare subsistence from the soil don’t care much about how their government works. As literacy, living standards and access to information rise, that changes. 
European and Ottoman history followed a similar pattern. Nationalism rose with levels of development—and democracy, linked to nationalism, was more often a destabilizing force leading to conflict than a calming force leading to peace. 
“Tribalism,” as ethnic nationalism in postcolonial Africa is sometimes dismissively and condescendingly called, is not a remnant of the past destined to fade as modernization progresses. It is a sleeping giant that, as it awakens, will test the stability and perhaps alter the borders of many African countries. 
World leaders can hope that the Ethiopian civil war will be quickly and peacefully resolved. But they should brace for a turbulent future, not only in Ethiopia, but across a rapidly developing continent.

2020/11/16,How to Save Kabul From Saigon’s Fate,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-save-kabul-from-saigons-fate-11605568086,"America has entered its 20th year of fighting in Afghanistan without victory. With a major troop drawdown imminent, many of the generals who failed to win are now well-positioned to prevent a disastrous defeat.
In a swift response to the 9/11 attacks, the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan shattered al Qaeda, driving its remnants into neighboring Pakistan. But then President George W. Bush decided to build Afghanistan into a democracy.
The generals enthusiastically took on an open-ended mission: “Soldiers and Marines are expected to be nation-builders as well as war-fighters,” decreed the 2006 counterinsurgency field manual. Grunts, however, soon learned they couldn’t win the hearts and minds of semiliterate tribesmen or stop the Taliban from using its Pakistani sanctuary to rearm. Still, our generals remained confident.
President Obama took office declaring that Afghanistan was “a war that we have to win.” But after making scant progress, he pulled out most U.S. troops. Mr. Trump further reduced U.S. forces to roughly 5,000, while greatly increasing the bombing.
In a tweet last month, the president promised to have all U.S. troops in Afghanistan home by Christmas. Mr. Trump can issue the order, but it would be impossible to carry out before he leaves office. Nevertheless, he seems determined to slash by half the few U.S. forces remaining in Iraq and Afghanistan. Such a quick and dirty drawdown would be the most irresponsible national-security decision of this tumultuous presidency. It will be applauded by terrorists and Iran and cause tremors in Kabul and Baghdad.
President-elect Biden will inherit a worsening situation. The Taliban will redouble their efforts to force out remaining U.S. troops. They can’t seize the cities as long as we are there to bomb them, but they control much of eastern Afghanistan. And whoever controls the ground controls the outcome after negotiations.
In 1972 the U.S. signed a peace treaty that left thousands of North Vietnamese soldiers in South Vietnam. A few years later, North Vietnamese tanks rolled into Saigon as the world watched on TV. Respect for American resolve plummeted at home and abroad.
The Taliban share Islamist roots with terrorists who pursue murder on a global scale. A total U.S. withdrawal would lead to a resurgence of terror plots, no longer in danger of disruption. Instead, the U.S. should continue what it is doing: keep military presence low and lethality high, and tolerate a messy government in Kabul. With modest expense and low casualties, the benefits of withdrawal can’t justify the costs.
In September, 22 retired four-star generals and admirals endorsed Mr. Biden for president. That list included many who shared responsibility for the profligate strategy of nation-building. Having helped to elect him, those generals should urge Mr. Biden to retain a small force in Afghanistan. The message should remain unchanged: Wherever ye gather in terror’s name, hell follows.
Mr. West, a military historian, has served as an assistant secretary of defense and a combat Marine. He is author of “The Last Platoon: A Novel of the Afghanistan War.”

2020/11/16,Two Existing Technologies Could Fight Covid Now,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-existing-technologies-could-fight-covid-now-11605567973,"The response to the Covid-19 epidemic has taken many forms, from targeted interventions to complete lockdowns. But even the most stringent lockdown was essentially a fiction for essential workers and the working poor, who had to perform their jobs despite the uncertainty and risk. For those confined to their homes and those who had no choice but to leave them, the mental and physical toll has been immense. It is past time to deploy a strategy that protects the vulnerable while interrupting airborne viral transmission in places where people come together. A balanced and layered approach can help open clinics, schools, businesses, houses of worship and society in general. 
Many are surprised to learn that there are low-cost and effective approaches already in widespread use outside the U.S. that can provide focused protection for the vulnerable and prevent transmission of viruses in indoor settings. The installation of a simple technology that deactivates germs could make public spaces safer against viruses and bacteria for decades. Also, while new vaccines are making the headlines, a nearly century-old vaccine that costs pennies per dose and is already used by hundreds of millions of people world-wide can help reduce severe outcomes from respiratory infections. 
The former tool is upper-room UVC germicidal lighting. These fixtures look like glorified bug-zappers, but the bugs they zap are viruses and bacteria, not insects. The technology has been around since 1937, when it was first used against a measles outbreak—an airborne virus more contagious than Covid-19—in a Philadelphia school. Studies show that when optimally used in concert with good ventilation systems, UVC germicidal lighting provides the same effect as completely replacing the air in a room more than 10 times an hour. This reduces transmission and is a safe, effective layer of protection against threatening airborne diseases in crowded indoor settings. 
The devices are manufactured in America and have been supplied to U.S.-funded programs around the world through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Outfitting indoor public spaces with these devices would cost considerably less than the trillions already spent by the federal government to mitigate the economic impact of this crisis. Our data from implementation of this approach in Oklahoma City indicate that installing these bug zappers in a typical building costs less than $6 a square foot. Maintenance and upkeep are cheap and simple. From Utica College in New York to the Salvation Army of Central Oklahoma, and from Los Angeles International Airport to the Cambridge Friends School in Massachusetts, these lights are already on and providing a layer of important protection. 
The second tool is a vaccine that hundreds of millions of people have taken for years with almost no side effects—the antituberculosis vaccine BCG. It has been used for almost a century to protect the most vulnerable against tuberculosis and can be almost immediately produced in large quantities at low cost. A study published last month in the journal Cell showed that BCG vaccination triggers a general immune response that decreases viral respiratory tract infections by 79% among the elderly. 
In a trial run in the United Arab Emirates, none of the hospital workers randomly assigned to receive a BCG booster developed Covid-19, while 8.6% of those who received no boosters were infected. While it appears that BCG is helpful on its own, it has also been shown to increase the efficacy of other vaccines. This is important because none of the major Covid-19 vaccine trials currently receiving attention are designed to detect a difference in severe disease or death. Urgent investment is needed for rapid multisite trials of BGC vaccination in the elderly and other vulnerable populations. This approach could save many lives right now.
These technologies have been around for a long time so their profit-making potential is limited. That could explain why they have been overlooked, but it has no bearing on their utility. U.S. foreign-aid programs have funded these approaches against infectious diseases for decades. If America were to fold them into its pandemic strategy alongside localized contact tracing, appropriate use of masks, targeted testing and, possibly, a new Covid vaccine, we would protect our essential workers and begin the process of safely reopening society.

2020/11/16,Notable & Quotable: The Biden Campaign,Notable & Quotable,https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-the-biden-campaign-11605567852,"From “Biden Won the Battle—but Dems Are Losing the Social Media War,” DailyBeast.com, Nov. 16:
“Impeachment was so bad for us because it fit into [Trump’s] meta-narrative that they reinforced every day,” said Tara McGowan, a leading Democratic digital strategist, referring to the persistent “deep state” conspiracy theories and allegations of Biden family corruption that pervaded conservative media amid the historic rebuke of the president.
Months later, as racial unrest erupted—occasionally violently—in cities around the country, Democrats faced the same feedback loop of conservative posts and commentary that reinforced some of the president’s central political messaging. The riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin, following the shooting of a Black man by police there created such a scare for the Biden digital team that it was one of the few times they advised the communications shop to forcefully push back against the emerging narrative (in this case, of Biden being on the side of the protesters).
“I don’t know that we would’ve been able to recover from the law-and-order narrative if the president himself hadn’t contracted the virus,” said McGowan, describing the president’s coronavirus diagnosis as a seminal moment that shifted the online conversation back to his poor handling of the pandemic. “Frankly, if the pandemic had not come,” she said, “I think we would’ve absolutely lost this presidential election.”

2020/11/16,The Supreme Court and the Challenge to the ACA,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-supreme-court-and-the-challenge-to-the-aca-11605558068,"Regarding your editorial “Supreme Misjudgment on ObamaCare” (Nov. 11): Texas Solicitor General Kyle D. Hawkins was not whistling Dixie, as you have suggested, when he explained to Chief Justice John Roberts that the remainder of the ObamaCare statute is not constitutionally severable from its now-repealed funding mandate. President Obama and the Democrats, themselves, did not include a severability clause in their statute even though such a clause is routinely included in most statutes. This was no unintended oversight on their part. Instead, it was how the Democrats obtained the acquiescence of the well-heeled health-insurance industry. Specifically, in exchange for that industry agreeing to insure persons with pre-existing conditions and 19 to 26-year-olds on their parents’ policies, Congress agreed to compel every American, via the mandate, to buy health insurance. This deal was also designed to keep President Obama’s promise (now long since broken) that our premiums would not go up. So please don’t mess with Texas.
John K. Haggerty
Santa Clara, Calif.
You quote Chief Justice Roberts saying to Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins: “I think it’s hard for you to argue that Congress intended the entire Act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same Congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the Act.” The counterargument I would have made is that clearly the members of Congress (all Democrats) who voted for the original bill had no intention of any kind except to pass it. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi famously said: “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.” Clearly, you can’t intend a bill to be something if you don’t even know what is in it. Additionally, those members had no reason to believe the mandate would ever be zeroed out, even if they were actually aware of such a thing in the bill. 
The court may rule in favor of keeping ObamaCare based on severability precedents, which is a legitimate reason, but many of us constitutionalists are weary of Justice Roberts making rulings and arguments based on his stated ability to mind read Congress. 
Tom Chalmers 
Old Bridge, N.J. 
The chief justice may have been correct that the intent of Congress in 2017 by repealing the tax was not to throw the entire structure of ObamaCare out the window, but he was wrong when he said it was not the Supreme Court’s job to determine whether the remainder of the statute was constitutionally permissible given the key change in its structure and the court’s earlier ruling which found the act constitutional only because of the tax. At this point the intent of Congress is irrelevant. The court’s duty is to test the amended statute against the Constitution. 
The chief justice’s comment is also inaccurate. Many in Congress wanted to repeal the entirety of the act but when that effort failed Congress decided to repeal the most unpopular aspect of the law. This is not the chronology of an effort by Congress to get the Supreme Court to do its dirty work. It is the story of politicians currying favor with voters by giving them what they want. That’s what Congress does.

2020/11/16,States Can Vote Without the Electoral College,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-can-vote-without-the-electoral-college-11605557983,"Regarding Steven E. Landsburg’s “Want a Coup? Abolish the Electoral College” (op-ed, Nov. 12): It is not obvious that the federal court’s assertion of control over presidential elections isn’t a greater threat to our constitutional framework than a popular election—particularly if the election is controlled by the states as required in the Constitution. It is arguable that the Supreme Court’s actions in 2000 created a precedent for further erosion of state control of presidential elections by federal courts, a circumstance that should be of greater concern to Mr. Landsburg than how voting by the states is applied to deciding presidential elections. Noting that proportional assignment of electors is already within the province of the states, extension to a de facto popular election can be fully compliant with the Constitution without exposing the republic to further risk. The same cannot be said for having the Supreme Court control a presidential election.
David Goodyear

The important strengths of our election system, as summarized by Mr. Landsburg, lie primarily in its noncentralized nature. We could maintain the distributed character of the election process while moving away from the Electoral College system and toward a popular-vote system.

2020/11/16,Tax Carbon and Leave The Rest to the Markets,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/tax-carbon-and-leave-the-rest-to-the-markets-11605557817,"Regarding “Car Makers Keen on Electric Push” (Business News, Nov. 10): It is true that we can do better than our current patchwork of state and federal auto regulations. Yet no matter how many electric vehicles we put on the road, more is needed to reduce our carbon emissions. We need to incentivize a gradual transition to clean-energy sources throughout our entire economy. 
The most cost-effective incentive is a price on carbon. By putting a price on carbon, consumers will be incentivized to choose clean, low-carbon energy sources. And auto makers, who respond to consumer demand, would be more willing to make long-term investments in electric technology. Instead of bogging down companies with more regulations, we should encourage them to focus on innovation.
Congress has a bill that would do just that. If enacted, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763) puts a price on carbon that starts low and gradually increases. The revenue generated gets returned as a monthly dividend to Americans who will spend it as they see fit. After all, it’s up to us which clean-energy path we choose.

2020/11/17,Rage Against the Voting Machine,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/rage-against-the-voting-machine-11605656036,"President Trump has so far been unwilling to concede to Joe Biden, and his latest argument is that the voting machines must have been rigged. Where’s the evidence? Strong claims need strong proof, not rumors and innuendo on Twitter.
Chatter is swirling around Dominion Voting, a company that supplies equipment in some 28 states. What seems to have launched this theory was an early misreport of results in Antrim County, Mich. In 2016 Mr. Trump won 62% of its 13,600 ballots, so eyebrows rose this year when the initial tallies showed Mr. Biden up by 3,000.
In reality, Mr. Trump had won 61% of Antrim County. The unofficial reporting was wrong, but the underlying votes were counted correctly. As officials later explained: In October the county had to tweak the ballot information for two local races. Tabulating machines in the affected areas were updated, but others weren’t. On Election Day the differing data didn’t line up right after being merged. But the printouts from the tabulators showed accurate totals.
In any case, the Michigan Secretary of State’s office said the error “would have been identified during the county canvass,” when Democrats and Republicans “review the printed totals tape from each tabulator.” Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy told the Associated Press: “There was no malice, no fraud here, just human error.” She’s a Republican.
A different problem hit Gwinnett County, Ga. Officials had trouble with a Dominion module for adjudicating absentee ballots, for example, if the voter put a check mark in the circle instead of filling it in. Some adjudicated ballots, the county said, “were displayed as in progress but would not move over to be accepted.” The county ended up re-adjudicating some votes until Nov. 5. Sounds like the usual boring IT snafu.
Other pundits mash together all sorts of stuff. A couple of counties in Georgia had trouble with electronic poll books, but that would affect wait times at precincts, not final vote totals. There’s footage from a House hearing a few years ago, at which Princeton Computer Science Professor Andrew Appel said that voting machines could theoretically be hacked. Where’s the proof they actually were in 2020? “Vulnerabilities,” Mr. Appel wrote in a blog post Friday, “are not the same as rigged elections, especially when we have paper ballots in almost all the states.”
Mr. Trump was even further astray last week in a tweet. “REPORT: DOMINION DELETED 2.7 MILLION TRUMP VOTES NATIONWIDE. DATA ANALYSIS FINDS 221,000 PENNSYLVANIA VOTES SWITCHED FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BIDEN. 941,000 TRUMP VOTES DELETED.” Dominion says it’s “impossible” that its machines deleted nearly a million Trump votes in Pennsylvania, where it serves only 14 counties. With turnout at 76%, it adds, those counties registered 1.3 million votes.
Others have tried to draw lines between Dominion and prominent Democrats. In the category of no good deed goes unpunished, the company in 2014 agreed to donate voting machines to “emerging and post-conflict democracies” via a Clinton Foundation initiative. This shows exactly nothing about Dominion’s current operations. The company says it has no ownership relationships “with any member of the Pelosi family, the Feinstein family, or the Clinton Global Initiative.”
Another rumor is that Dominion has deep ties with Smartmatic, which has supplied voting systems to Venezuela, where the ruling regime manipulates elections. Both companies deny this. Smartmatic says it “has never provided Dominion Voting Systems with any software, hardware or other technology.” Dominion says they “do not collaborate in any way and have no affiliate relationships or financial ties.” In 2009, Dominion adds, Smartmatic “licensed Dominion machines for use in the Philippines,” but the contract “ended in a lawsuit.”
No voting system is foolproof, and hiccups are inevitable in a country with roughly 3,000 counties. The distributed nature of American elections is a strength on this point, since voting is handled by innumerable local officials instead of a few central authorities. Texas has declined to certify Dominion systems for its elections. The examiners objected to everything from the “tedious” and “unintuitive” setup, to a crash they witnessed in an adjudication module, to an indicator light that hackers could hypothetically remove to get at a USB port.
But so far there’s no good evidence of voting problems that would come close to Mr. Biden’s lead of 73,000 votes in Pennsylvania or 145,000 in Michigan. In Georgia, the Republican Secretary of State last week ordered a hand recount of all five million ballots. The effort turned up 2,600 missing votes that Floyd County forgot to upload. Adding them would cut Mr. Biden’s lead to slightly north of 13,000. But the error isn’t Dominion’s fault, and it better hope no glitches are revealed, given its 10-year contract with the state for $107 million.
If Georgia’s recount doesn’t find big irregularities, then these claims should be put to rest. In the George W. Bush years, the conspiratorial left focused on Diebold, a maker of electronic voting machines. It would be a mistake for anyone on the right to go down a similar dead end, especially if Georgia’s paper ballots give the same result as the computers.

2020/11/17,Another Obama Lecture,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/another-obama-lecture-11605567605,"Former President Barack Obama, who presided over historic abuses of government surveillance powers, is once again attacking one of the principal targets. Four years after the Obama Justice Department misled a federal court into approving a surveillance warrant against a Trump campaign associate, Mr. Obama is comparing President Donald Trump to a murderous dictator.
Asked by Scott Pelley in a Sunday interview for the CBS News program “60 Minutes” about Mr. Trump’s claims of voter fraud in the recent election, Mr. Obama responded: 
Whatever one thinks of Mr. Trump’s claims—or Mr. Obama’s over-the-top comparison to dictators—Mr. Pelley has chosen one of America’s least credible advocates for presidential restraint. 
Bradford Betz of Fox News reasonably notes:
Early in Mr. Obama’s second term the AP reported:
Speaking of massive and unprecedented intrusions and attempts to delegitimize a presidential administration, it was four years ago this month that the Obama FBI fired Christopher Steele as a confidential source for cause, learned new reasons to doubt his reports, and also learned that he was working on behalf of the Hillary Clinton campaign—yet still continued to promote his bogus claims of Russian collusion. 
But now Mr. Pelley of CBS presents Mr. Obama as a gracious predecessor. The tough interrogator from CBS even presses Mr. Obama, who is publishing his latest autobiography, to concede that he may have been too kind to political opponents. Here’s the CBS transcript:
What a guy. 
As for Mr. Pelley, readers may recall him as the author of a bizarre commentary in 2017 when he was preparing to vacate the CBS News nightly anchor chair. After a gunman shot at Republicans practicing for a congressional baseball game, Mr. Pelley said it was “time to ask” whether the attack was “to some degree, self-inflicted.”
Now Mr. Pelley is making another odd claim:
Of course America would have been better off if Mr. Obama had followed the time-honored commandment to avoid surveilling your successor’s campaign. But even on its face the Pelley claim is questionable. Mr. Obama publicly criticized his successor within 10 days of Mr. Trump’s inauguration. More recently, Mr. Obama lambasted Mr. Trump at the virtual Democratic convention in August, and at various stops along the autumn campaign trail. Mr. Pelley’s own network reported last month on a speech in which “Mr. Obama delivered a sweeping condemnation of Trump”.

The Obama administration represented a break with tradition in terms of federal law enforcement’s relationship with politics and the press. But even Americans who don’t participate in Republican campaigns or work in media may be concerned about their free speech rights when they ponder Mr. Obama’s latest ideas for improving public discourse. The former President told Mr. Pelley:

2020/11/17,Newsom Gets His BLM Orders,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/newsom-gets-his-blm-orders-11605655728,"Identity politics was a debacle for Democrats on Nov. 3, not least in California where voters defeated a constitutional amendment to allow racial preferences in schools and government. But don’t tell that to Black Lives Matter, which has delivered its new orders to Gov. Gavin Newsom : “He Must Appoint a Black Woman to the Senate.”
The internet message to supporters says that, with Kamala Harris leaving to be Vice President, the Senate will soon have no black women. They recommend Reps. Karen Bass or Barbara Lee. South Carolina’s Tim Scott is a black Republican man, who doesn’t count in BLM world. 
Let’s see what Mr. Newsom does. He has presidential ambitions and rarely bucks progressive interest groups. On the other hand, the vote against racial preferences was 57.1%-42.9%, and the measure lost in 52 of 58 counties.

2020/11/17,Judy Shelton’s Heresy,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/judy-sheltons-heresy-11605655677," Judy Shelton’s nomination to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors failed to move ahead in the Senate Tuesday amid two Senate GOP absences due to Covid. But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reserved the right to vote again, and we hope the Senate does. She deserves to be confirmed—not least because of the ugly campaign against her. 
Ms. Shelton was nominated in January and the Banking Committee approved her in July. But Republicans Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lamar Alexander oppose her, though the reasons fail on inspection.
Ms. Shelton holds advanced degrees in economic fields—Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is a lawyer—and has participated in monetary-policy debates since the 1980s. The objection is to her opinions. Those have been branded unconventional, though the Fed lately has adopted some and proven how right she is in others. Her GOP critics think she’s not independent enough from President Trump, though that is irrelevant after the election. They also accuse her of flip-flopping to oppose low interest rates during Barack Obama’s term and then support low rates once Mr. Trump was in office.
But the Fed flipped too. As asset prices soared and the economy recovered after the financial crisis, she said the Fed should normalize policy and raise rates. Instead the Fed waited until late 2015, when unemployment was falling without sparking renewed inflation. Now she observes that if there is no evidence inflation is taking hold, the Fed should not view historically low unemployment as a reason to raise rates prematurely.
Which is precisely what the Fed has done in the strategic review it unveiled this summer. The Fed is abandoning in all but name the discredited Phillips Curve that posited low unemployment would trigger inflation. Instead policy makers will wait to see inflation rising for some time before raising rates.
Ms. Shelton differs from Fed orthodoxy in preferring that the central bank eschew attempts to micromanage the economy and focus instead on stability as measured by exchange rates and asset and commodity prices. The Fed has gone in the opposite direction in adopting an “average inflation target” that effectively gives it carte blanche to do whatever it wants for whatever reason.
If you worry about politicized central banking, this is a far greater danger than any interest-rate policy Ms. Shelton has advocated. The Fed is unmooring from objective benchmarks and subjecting itself to pressure from Capitol Hill and the White House to manipulate how it calculates the “average” in its target. 
As for Fed independence, Mr. Powell is joined at the hip with the Trump Treasury and is suggesting he’ll do whatever the Biden Treasury wants as well. He has endorsed more fiscal stimulus, which is not in his policy mandate, and is hinting he’ll buy as many bonds and keep interest rates as low as the powers-that-be want. Failing to confirm Ms. Shelton will leave the seat for Joe Biden to fill.
The fury unleashed against Ms. Shelton is far out of proportion to the power she’d have. She’d be one of seven board members and one of 12 on the Open Market Committee. Yet Washington’s political-media class treats her like an invading vandal.
 Tony Fratto, a public-relations man in the Bush Treasury who is now a partner in a Beltway influence shop, says “Judy Shelton deserves zero votes from the Senate. The Federal Reserve Board isn’t a toy.” The media quoted this glib line as if from a monetary oracle, but it shows Ms. Shelton’s real offense is that she’s not a member of the Washington club.
Ms. Shelton’s monetary views used to be considered a policy disagreement, but nowadays they’re heresy. All the more reason to confirm her as an independent voice.

2020/11/17,Confirmation Mischief at the FCC,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/confirmation-mischief-at-the-fcc-11605655557,"Approving federal judges is a priority for Mitch McConnell during the lame-duck session of Congress, but Republicans shouldn’t dither on confirming Nathan Simington to the Federal Communications Commission. He will be needed to oppose internet regulation early in a Biden Presidency.
Mr. Simington’s confirmation is in jeopardy because of—who else?—President Trump. In August Mr. Trump yanked GOP Commissioner Michael O’Rielly’s five-year renomination because he expressed reservations about the legality of an executive order directing the FCC to regulate online speech under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
Mr. Trump then nominated Mr. Simington, an adviser at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), who supports the executive order. While some Senate Republicans want to revise Section 230 to limit liability protections for online platforms, that’s their job, not the FCC’s. We criticized Mr. Trump for his ham-handed move, but Republicans would be committing self-sabotage by scotching Mr. Simington’s confirmation.
Chairman Ajit Pai is expected to follow long-standing agency tradition by stepping down in January, which is also when Mr. O’Rielly must vacate his seat. If Senate Republicans don’t confirm Mr. Simington in the lame duck, Democrats would have a 2-1 commission majority to start the Biden Presidency so they could immediately get to work. 
At the top of their agenda is reinstating the Obama FCC net neutrality order regulating broadband providers like utilities under Title II of the Communications Act. Democrats also aim to expand customer discount programs like Lifeline and use FCC spectrum auctions to raise revenue to spend without approval from Congress. Another top priority: Rolling back FCC rules that limit how much cities can charge telecom companies for 5G cell sites. And don’t rule out a revival of the Fairness Doctrine regulating speech. All of this would hurt the economy and slow the rollout of 5G.
Confirming Mr. Simington would tie the commission 2-2 in January and slow these plans. It took Mr. Pai nearly a year into President Trump’s term to repeal the Obama Title II regulation. Democrats wouldn’t be able to move until they have a majority. 
While Mr. Biden can nominate a third Democrat to the FCC, the Senate need not act on the nomination immediately. If Republicans hold the Senate, they could demand concessions to confirm his nominee. But if Mr. Biden has a 2-1 majority to start his term, he could delay nominating a third Democrat and second Republican to fill out the commission.
Republicans shouldn’t get hung up on Section 230. Mr. Trump’s order will be moot Jan. 20, and Mr. Simington otherwise opposes heavy-handed telecom regulation. The FCC “must be thoughtful about potential chilling effects on development if its regulatory efforts go over the line and become intrusive, disruptive, and burdensome,” he noted at his confirmation hearing last week.
A source says some GOP Senate staff are stalling Mr. Simington’s confirmation because they’re angling for the seat in a Biden Presidency. That’s self-serving and short-sighted. Mr. Simington deserves to be confirmed in the lame duck.

2020/11/17,Elon Musk’s Next Frontier,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-next-frontier-11605655365,"Except for a Covid diagnosis, it’s been a great week for entrepreneur Elon Musk. His rocket and spacecraft company SpaceX scored another success and his electric-car company Tesla hit a huge market milestone. But will shares in the latter experience the pull of gravity when consumers study the environmental costs?
Jackie Wattles of CNN reports on Mr. Musk’s latest triumph, which occurred 262 miles above the earth:
Scott Neuman and Russell Lewis of National Public Radio add:
Resilience is the name of the capsule that carried the astronauts. Back on earth, shares in Mr. Musk’s car company have been much more than resilient. On Monday S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that the soaring Tesla shares will join the S&P 500 stock index on Dec. 21. 
The Journal’s Heather Somerville reported Monday:
The race to electrify the auto industry has lately been profitable for Tesla. But as the Journal’s Amrith Ramkumar reports, there’s a difference between Tesla and the other tech giants like Apple and Microsoft that make up an increasing share of the S&P 500: 
To this point Tesla doubters have indeed been punished for their skepticism. But there remain questions about the composition of Tesla’s earnings, not just their size. In September, the Journal’s Gunjan Banerji and Michael Wursthorn explained why the company had not already been added to the S&P 500:
Investors who believe that Tesla will need to rely on favorable environmental policy and/or enthusiastic environmentally conscious consumers to meet growth expectations may be interested in a new report from Ben Lieberman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. He notes that an electric vehicle (EV) carries its own environmental consequences, including from the mining of materials to create its battery, the significant energy needed to manufacture it, and the challenge of disposing of spent batteries. Mr. Lieberman adds:
As for the benefits of electric cars, they may fall well short of the expectations of environmentally sensitive consumers, especially if, as is likely, the U.S. continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels to generate electricity. Mr. Lieberman writes:

2020/11/17,Debating the Wisdom of Contesting the Election,Future View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/debating-the-wisdom-of-contesting-the-election-11605655075,"Editor’s note: In this Future View, students evaluate the Trump campaign’s decision to challenge election results. Next week we’ll ask, “Should the Biden administration cancel student debt?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Nov. 24. The best responses will be published that night.
Focus on the Battle Ahead
Now is not the time to be greedy. Republicans have beaten the odds and gained seats in the House, but the Senate majority still hangs in the balance. Fighting an uphill legal battle and spreading conspiracies about a rigged election can only distract voters in Georgia from what is at stake in the state’s two runoff elections for Senate. Right now, the Republican Party’s top priority should be to inform voters about the progressive agenda to pack the court, get rid of the Senate filibuster, raise taxes and pass the Green New Deal.
—Mason Brady, Vanderbilt University, economics

The Need to Investigate
Should President Trump stop claiming that he won the election? Yes. He hasn’t won, as far as we know. Nevertheless, challenging certain results and investigating possible fraud is necessary to restore faith in democracy. A recent poll taken by Politico found that 70% of Republicans don’t think the election was “free and fair.” If the GOP fails to investigate the key results to its voters’ satisfaction, millions of Americans will lose confidence in the integrity of our elections. That isn’t good for either party or the country as a whole.
—Reed Senterfitt, University of Texas at Austin, finance
No Sense in Holding Out
Trump loyalists are embarrassing themselves by refusing to accept the reality: Their candidate lost. Everyone else sees this, including the Republicans who aren’t Trump loyalists. Trying to salvage the GOP’s respectability, dozens of prominent Republicans have spoken out against the president’s evidence-free claims of voter fraud. But this is no easy task when Mr. Trump promotes conspiracies about a stolen election. 
I know that voter fraud is real; as an intern last year, one of my jobs was to input case data into the Heritage Foundation’s voter-fraud database. But to vindicate Mr. Trump, the number of fraudulent votes the Democrats would have had to cast is inconceivable. And besides, in the course of perpetrating a massive fraud against the republic, are we to believe that the master string-pullers forgot about the House and the Senate? It doesn’t add up.
By pushing unfounded claims. Mr. Trump and his loyalists undermine the democratic process, which is supposed to confer legitimacy on elected officials so they can govern peacefully. It’s time for the holdouts to give it up and accept defeat. They should join the rest of the country in extending their congratulations to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as we all ensure another peaceful transition of power.
—Cooper Conway, Boise State University, political science

Follow the Founders’ Lead
The election of 1800 was ripe with acrimony. Democratic-Republican presidential candidate Thomas Jefferson had been accused of selling out America to French interests, while Federalist President John Adams had been accused of seeking the tyrannical powers associated with George III. Still, when the time came on March 4, 1801, Adams relinquished his office peacefully to Jefferson. It was the first instance in the U.S. of one party handing over power to the other, establishing a precedent that has continued to the present day.
To ensure the future stability of the republic, Republicans have an obligation to follow the wisdom of our founding fathers and concede. That means accepting that the people chose Joe Biden to be president—and not resorting to unfounded accusations of fraud.

2020/11/17,Behind the Elite Hatred of Clarence Thomas,Upward Mobility,https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-elite-hatred-of-clarence-thomas-11605654039,"When an interviewer asked me what I made of Joy Reid’s insulting Justice Clarence Thomas on MSNBC earlier this month, I said it was disappointing but hardly surprising. The black left has been calling Justice Thomas a race traitor for decades. It’s what they do when they can’t refute his arguments.
During an Election Day panel discussion with Rachel Maddow and Nicolle Wallace, Ms. Reid referred in passing to “Uncle Clarence”—a play on “Uncle Tom,” the epithet used to describe a black man who is servile toward whites. Either MSNBC is OK with its hosts using racial slurs on the air, or the network is under the impression that Ms. Reid and the justice are related.

In any case, she joins a long list of liberal black elites—journalists, activists, academics, politicians—attacking Justice Thomas as a sellout for having the audacity to disagree with them on racial issues generally and on affirmative action in particular. Testifying against Justice Thomas’s confirmation in 1991, Rep. Major Owens likened him to Vidkun Quisling, the Norwegian military officer who collaborated with the Nazis. On PBS in 1994, the political commentator Julianne Malveaux remarked: “I hope his wife feeds him lots of eggs and butter and he dies early, like many black men do, of heart disease.”
The press often presents the views of black elites as representative of the views of most blacks. In fact, Justice Thomas was always more popular with average black people than the media led us to believe. Most blacks backed his nomination to the Supreme Court, both before and after Anita Hill’s allegations of inappropriate sexual talk. “Polls consistently revealed that the majority of the black populace supported Thomas’s nomination and that the lower the income level, the greater the support,” according to the veteran grass-roots activist Robert Woodson. “At the same time, Clarence Thomas’s greatest antagonists were leaders of the civil rights establishment who viewed his positions as a threat to their agenda of race-based grievances.”
Justice Thomas has long argued that racial preferences not only stigmatize black achievement but are far more likely to help those who were already better off rather than the black underclass in whose name these policies are advocated. When the likes of Joy Reid knock him for this view, they are acting in their own self-interest, not in the interest of most black people.
This divergence in opinion between intellectuals and the broader society isn’t unique to blacks. White intellectuals don’t speak for most whites, either. Still, confusing the wants and needs of most black people with those of black elites can lead to dire consequences for the former. Blacks overwhelmingly support school choice, for example, while groups like the NAACP, which claim to speak in the interest of the black poor, oppose vouchers and want a moratorium on public charter schools. That position benefits the NAACP, which is rewarded with donations from teachers unions, but how does it help a poor family with children trapped in a chronically failing school?
The killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis earlier this year brought nationwide calls from black activists, elected officials and the media to “defund the police.” But when the people forced to live in high-crime neighborhoods were consulted, only a small percentage cited overpolicing as the problem. A Gallup poll released in August reported that 81% of black respondents wanted the police presence in their community to remain the same or increase, while only 19% wanted it reduced. In a separate survey released last year, 59% of black residents of low-income neighborhoods said that “they would like the police to spend more time in their area than they currently do,” versus only 50% of white residents.
Calls to reduce police resources don’t reflect black opinion in general so much as the views of elites who are least likely to reside in these communities or bear the consequences of scapegoating law enforcement. In Minneapolis, the protests were followed by dozens of police department retirements and resignations. More than 100 officers have taken leaves of absences, morale is low, and recruitment efforts have lagged. The department is now overwhelmed and violent crime in the city has skyrocketed.
“So far this year, 491 people have been wounded by gunfire,” Minnesota Public Radio reported last week. “The city’s gunshot tally is more than double the amount at this time last year.” The city’s poor residents are the most common victims of violent crime, but so long as the shootings don’t involve law enforcement, the activists and politicians and commentators are unlikely to make much of a fuss. They’re too busy searching for the next police shooting to exploit politically, or on television belittling black people who dare to think for themselves.

2020/11/17,One Agency for Antitrust,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-agency-for-antitrust-11605653810,"Enforcement of U.S. antitrust laws has been divided for more than a century between the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. We’ve had more than enough time to see that this arrangement doesn’t work. I will soon introduce the One Agency Act to put all federal antitrust enforcement under one roof. 
No one would intentionally design the system we have today. Even Justice and the FTC, when helping other nations set up their own competition authorities, don’t advocate separate enforcers. Effective and efficient antitrust enforcement is essential to maintaining free markets and protecting consumers. But the status quo of divided law enforcement undermines these objectives.
Currently, Justice and the FTC work under an arrangement in which each agency must get “clearance” from the other before opening an investigation. This regularly leads to turf battles as lawyers from each agency fight over who gets the case. Jurisdiction over one merger was literally decided by a coin toss.
Every year government lawyers spend hundreds of hours managing these fights, wasting taxpayer money and delaying enforcement of the antitrust laws that protect American consumers. This is no way to run a government. When they aren’t fighting, Justice and the FTC engage in their own form of market allocation, assigning certain industries to each agency. Most health-care cases go to the FTC, while energy cases go to Justice. This avoids waste, but it also creates the risk of different industries receiving different antitrust enforcement. The strength of antitrust enforcement shouldn’t hinge on a coin toss or a backroom deal.
The recent case against Qualcomm is the clearest example of the potential for conflicting enforcement policy. After the FTC won at trial, Justice supported Qualcomm in its successful appeal. Two federal agencies, tasked with enforcing the same laws on behalf of the federal government, argued against each other in court. That is the definition of a broken system.
The One Agency Act would solve these problems by moving all antitrust enforcement to the Justice Department, which is more politically accountable to voters and the only agency that can oversee criminal cases. This will make our antitrust enforcers stronger and more effective, eliminate waste and delays, and ensure the federal government speaks with a single voice on antitrust. This is an obvious good-government solution—a win for consumers and the economy.

2020/11/17,Lockdowns Have a Bright Side for Teens,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/lockdowns-have-a-bright-side-for-teens-11605653768,"Here’s a silver lining in the Covid-19 pandemic: Teens are talking more with their parents and showing signs of improved mental health, according to a survey from the Institute for Family Studies (where I am a contributing editor).
The study, released in October, found that 56% of 1,523 U.S. high school students surveyed between May and July reported talking to their parents more during quarantine than before. Fifty-four percent said their families have dinner together more often, 46% reported spending more time with siblings, and 68% said their families had become closer during the pandemic. 
More surprisingly, the share of teens reporting depression dropped from 27% in 2018 to 17% in the spring of 2020, when remote school was in session, though it edged up to 20% over the summer. What accounts for this counterintuitive result? The IFS study cites two reasons: increased time with family and more sleep. 
Time with families buffers kids from depression. They may be sad or in distress, but parents are there to comfort them and help them regulate their emotions and handle conflict. This doesn’t mean coddling, but helping them learn to cope with intense feelings. Parents’ physical and emotional presence promotes emotional security, the foundation of resilience. 
More sleep is equally important. During puberty, a natural change in circadian rhythms called “sleep phase delay” makes teens feel tired later at night than they are used to. That often means a later bedtime without a shift in early-morning school routines, which can result in sleep deprivation. School start times have moved earlier over the years to accommodate working parents at the expense of critical sleep for adolescents. But during the pandemic, without a commute, many teens are finding that they are able to follow their natural sleeping patterns. Poor sleep has been significantly linked to teen depression in previous research.
Lockdowns have been very difficult for adolescents in many ways, and no one favors keeping them in effect longer than necessary to contain the virus. But it’s important to recognize the benefits so that we can work to integrate them into youngsters’ lives after the health crisis is over. Teen sleep should remain a priority, and schools should consider starting the day later when they reopen. Parents should work to spend more time with their children. Schools should consider continuing their Covid-induced flexibility with deadlines and eliminating standardized tests for college entrance, a prime source of teen anxiety. 
Not all the news from the IFS study is good. Teens reported higher levels of unhappiness and dissatisfaction with life, as you’d expect when they’re deprived of activity and contact with peers. But with more family time, more sleep and less academic pressure, they are less depressed and becoming more resilient. There’s always opportunity in adversity, even in a deadly pandemic.

2020/11/17,Biden’s Tough Job: Uniting Americans ,Politics & Ideas,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-tough-job-uniting-americans-11605653620,"More than half a century ago, in the waning weeks of the 1968 presidential contest, a young girl attended a Nixon campaign event holding a sign that read “Bring us together again.” This would be the theme of Mr. Nixon’s speech the night he beat Vice President Hubert Humphrey and former Gov. George Wallace of Alabama. 
A quarter-century later, on the night of his own victory, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton declared his intention to “bring us together as never before.” 
Sixteen years after that declaration, President-elect Barack Obama, who had attracted national attention with his famous vision of an America neither red nor blue but one and united, spoke of his “determination to heal the divisions that have held back our progress.” He cited the lines from Abraham Lincoln’s First Inaugural Address that inspired Joe Biden’s victory speech 10 days ago.
They and the many others who have uttered similar thoughts were certainly sincere, and I don’t cite this history to promote cynicism. But it illustrates the difficulty of translating these good intentions into results. Still, it is not impossible. Jimmy Carter began his inaugural address this way: “For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.”
 Gerald Ford deserved this accolade. For the 895 days of his presidency, he worked to mend the national fabric torn by Vietnam, Watergate and the Central Intelligence Agency’s misdeeds. Defying conservatives in his own party, he governed from the center, and he paid the price—a challenge from Ronald Reagan that nearly cost him the Republican nomination in 1976. To rein in the imperial presidency, he minimized the use of executive privilege, which led to congressional inquiries he could not control. He made the difficult decision to give Nixon an unconditional pardon and spare the country a bitterly divisive prosecution. His press secretary resigned and some accused him of striking a corrupt bargain with his predecessor. His public approval fell precipitously and never fully recovered before Election Day. But he put the country ahead of political self-interest.

If President-elect Biden is serious about healing a divided nation, he will have to take steps that won’t be popular in his own party. For example, he won’t encourage the Justice Department to open investigations that could lead to the prosecution of Mr. Trump. If Mr. Trump’s infamous “lock her up” chant is met with calls to “lock him up,” the country will have taken another step toward the criminalization of political conflict—a hallmark of banana republics.
A Biden presidency that puts healing first will govern from the center, as Ford did. Mr. Biden should lead off his legislative agenda on areas where bipartisan agreement should be possible, such as a national plan to ensure speedy vaccine distribution and adequate supplies of personal protective equipment. He should resist promoting steps, such as a national mask mandate, that are bound to provoke political controversy and constitutional challenges. He can instead work with the National Governors Association and set out constitutionally permissible conditions on states receiving federal funds. 
Above all, a healing presidency will regard compromise not as a disagreeable necessity but as an opportunity to acknowledge the legitimacy of competing opinions, interests and principles in a large, pluralistic republic. Legal status for the “Dreamers” is important, and so is border security. Reforming police practices and the criminal-justice system is essential; so is the enforcement of the law against those who destroy property and commit violence, whatever their motives. Equality for all Americans without regard to race is a moral imperative, but Americans can disagree in good faith about the best means for making this equality a reality. A president who seeks compromise will do his best to respect his opponents’ red lines, even if he disagrees with them. 
These arguments may strike partisans as unprincipled. But the country is both closely and deeply divided. Although Americans agree on much more than party leaders and advocacy groups will acknowledge, their divisions run deeper than they did three decades ago. Red America cannot force its will on blue America, or vice versa, and secession is both undesirable and infeasible. The only answer is to learn to live with differences.
Ambitious presidents must respect public opinion, even as they seek to change it. “Public sentiment is everything,” Abraham Lincoln famously declared. “With it, nothing can fail; against it, nothing can succeed.” Lincoln confined his proposition to “this age,” but it’s every bit as relevant today.

2020/11/17,A Vaccine Is Already Helping,Business World,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-vaccine-is-already-helping-11605653459,"Now comes the news, for the second time in a week, that an experimental vaccine has proved surprisingly effective against Covid-19. Moderna’s vaccine, like Pfizer’s , has shown early protection higher than 90%. Also heard are caveats: Doses won’t be available for months. But the news may be better than we think. These announcements materially change incentives now, especially for the young who are the key spreaders.
This is a disease, let’s remind ourselves, that people essentially choose to share. Keep a physical distance from other human beings and you will not get it or give it. Every American, more explicitly than you might suppose, has been selecting a level of risk. You can confirm this by asking your friends and relatives. Remember all those accusatory stories about last summer’s Sturgis motorcycle rally? Reporters constantly tripped over the fact that attendees said they carefully weighed their risks.
Guess what also kills visitors to Sturgis? Motorcycle accidents. Would an enthusiast be less likely to attend if he or she knew next year there would be a vaccine against motorcycle accidents? Yes.
The U.S. is reaching another peak in hospitalizations, after April’s and July’s. So is Europe, quite clearly because young people everywhere started defecting from social-distancing strictures that impose a heavy economic and psychological cost on them and a much smaller one on older, settled people whose socializing and mate-hunting days are long behind them. The Germans even produced a poster of an elderly woman wearing a mask holding up a middle finger to those who didn’t. No message was better calculated to encapsulate the let’s-eat-our-young-to-save-ourselves spirit of the early, sweeping, misguided lockdowns.
For exactly this reason, an imminent vaccine alters incentives for the young more than the old. Life- and soul-sacrificing physical distancing has an end date—it’s not an indefinite obligation imposed on the young to benefit others. We also now know that bar hopping and crowded indoor parties cause much of the spread. These activities can be put on hold for another few months without putting everything on hold.
Governments quietly have come to understand that shutdown orders aimed at bars, gyms and restaurants are valuable mainly for signaling. Closing a bar that had 90 patrons in August and nine now doesn’t actually do much. It’s the personal decision-making that creates leverage to turn down the level of transmission. And even with pandemic fatigue, even with distrust of the news, Americans do seem to respond to local hospital overload.
This is also why, against the tide of opinion in favor of vaccinating the elderly first, a group of researchers at Johns Hopkins and the University of Southern California has argued cogently that vaccinating the young, who have the least to fear from Covid and suffer most under social restrictions, is a better idea. It would do more to curb the spread and ultimately prevent deaths.

So vaccine announcements are a reason to be hopeful—even with colder weather. But the universal trumpeting of confirmed case counts remains an insidious problem. Consider a few numbers: 80% of cases are mild or asymptomatic. They run their course in 15 days. Transmission is believed to require 15 minutes of contact within 6 feet.
Put these numbers together, and if infections were really only 11 million in the U.S. since the epidemic began eight months ago, you’d be crazy to worry about Covid. Your implied chances of catching it from a random encounter would be nil.
I’m not saying people do this calculation explicitly, but they do something like it implicitly. Now the media are trying to repair their own cognitive dissonance. A New York Times piece on Monday declared the pandemic “so widespread that every American knows someone who has been infected.” A 62-year-old teacher was quoted: “Before, we were watching the numbers on the news. Now it’s started creeping into my neighborhood, my school, my home—right where I’m existing.’’
The “numbers on the news” were meaningless, based on confirmed cases. If the teacher had been correctly informed, she would have known to expect Covid to be rife in her circle long before anyone bothered to get a test or become a confirmed case.
As I’ve argued, we made an incomprehensible mistake we never would have made with the flu, confusing confirmed cases with true prevalence. Groupthink is absurdly powerful in the press but reporters in Kentucky, armed with a study by local university economists, lately taxed Gov. Andy Beshear about relying on data that mislead about the disease’s true extent. Good for them. His answer was a study in confusion about sampling and measurement. The worst effect isn’t that reliance on confirmed cases causes Americans to overestimate the death risk from Covid, though it does. It causes them to underestimate by an order of magnitude the likelihood that the person next to them is a transmitter.

2020/11/17,Will Biden Help Cuba’s Trafficked Doctors?,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-biden-help-cubas-trafficked-doctors-11605643728,"Some of Joe Biden’s advisers are openly advocating returning to President Obama’s policy of appeasing leftist dictatorships in Latin America, starting with easing economic restrictions on Cuba. The beauty of broadly applying the Magnitsky Act to Cuban and other foreign government officials guilty of human-rights abuses, as recommended by Paula Dobriansky and David Rivkin (“How Trump or Biden Can Get Serious About Human Rights in Cuba,” op-ed, Nov. 12), is that unlike embargoes that garner widespread opposition at home and abroad, it would be unassailable; and in the case of Cuba, an effective way to bring real pressure to bear on the regime. This is especially timely—with Cuba reeling under the impact of greatly reduced support from Venezuela and the regime facing mounting opposition at home, including from the Roman Catholic Church.

Mr. Briggs served sequentially as U.S. ambassador to Panama, Honduras and Portugal 1982-93.
Ms. Dobriansky and Mr. Rivkin present a strong case for taking action against the Cuban slave trade in medical doctors, but there is an even better solution: Hire the doctors to work in the U.S. This would require reactivating the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, begun by President George W. Bush in 2006 and terminated by President Obama in 2017. A June report from the Association of American Medical Colleges projects that the U.S. will face a shortage of between 54,100 and 139,000 physicians by 2033; if we can bring in some of those 50,000 Cuban doctors, that would be a nice start to address the shortage. Add to that the fact that the U.S. has a population that is 18% Hispanic, while only 5% of doctors are Hispanic, and there is a clear case for encouraging Cuban doctors to defect. Cuban doctors whose consciences have led them into medicine to help underserved populations will find that there are plenty of underserved Americans who will appreciate their medical care, treasure their ability to speak Spanish and provide them with a meaningful career.

2020/11/18,Thank You for Voting and Get Out,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/thank-you-for-voting-and-get-out-11605740873,"‘Thank you and get out and please come again,” Apu, the canceled convenience store owner from “The Simpsons,” tells a departing customer. The Democratic Party has a similar attitude toward progressives: They need our business but they don’t want us around. This year establishment centrists have raised ingratitude to a high art since Joe Biden won the election without coattails.
 Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, who nearly lost her seat after she became the target of outsider-funded attack ads accusing her of allying herself with “defund-the-police extremists,” attacked progressives in a conference call. “We need to not ever use the word ‘socialist’ or ‘socialism’ ever again,” she said. “When [voters] see the far left . . . they get scared,” added Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon. “They’re very afraid that this will become a supernanny state.”
To hear them talk, you might think this was a repeat of 2016, when many progressives who supported Bernie Sanders stayed home. It wasn’t. Left populists, more opposed to Donald Trump than bummed out by Mr. Biden, swallowed hard and deferred their dreams of Medicare for All and a Green New Deal. Mr. Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned tirelessly for the Biden-Harris ticket.
Anti-Trump vote-shaming appears to have proved effective. We don’t have data on progressive turnout yet, but we know that Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins managed only 0.25% of the vote—less than one-fourth the 2016 share and so little that the party may have trouble obtaining ballot access in future elections.
It’s clear Mr. Biden’s strategy of appealing to anti-Trump Republicans—of which I was skeptical during the campaign—worked. And contrary to their image, progressives are realists. Two to four years from now, they’ll understand that Mitch McConnell’s Senate stood in the way of significant progressive legislation.
What they won’t accept is being scapegoated. The election makes the party’s deep division between centrists and progressives much worse. Centrists told progressives they’d be welcomed into the big tent if they played nice. Progressives did everything they were asked, yet are being insulted and reviled as much as before. How much more abuse are they willing to take?

2020/11/18,Biden Should Impose Conditions on Rejoining WHO,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-should-impose-conditions-on-rejoining-who-11605740793,"Joe Biden says he’ll take the U.S. back into the World Health Organization on his first day in office, reversing the withdrawal President Trump began in July. That would be a mistake. The coronavirus pandemic revealed the WHO as an agency ruinously in thrall to China. Rushing back in would reinforce this problem, not solve it.
The U.S. should require the WHO to meet two conditions before resuming the lavish flow of funds, expertise and credibility that U.S. membership has long conferred. First, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization’s China-pandering chief, needs to resign. His five-year term expires in mid-2022 but he needs to go sooner. His deference to China’s Communist Party, at the expense of world health, has produced the WHO’s most catastrophic failure since its founding in 1948. 
Second, the WHO should invite Taiwan to its proceedings, despite Beijing’s objections. Unlike Communist China, with its coverups and totalitarian lockdowns, Taiwan has done an exemplary job of combining the rights of a free society with the rigors of disease control. While Taiwan might have little to learn from the WHO, it has plenty to offer.
These measures may sound like a tall order, but it’s clear that big changes are needed at the WHO. Most of all, the WHO needs a director-general more devoted to health and less devoted to Beijing. Mr. Tedros isn’t a medical doctor but a politician with a Ph.D. in community health. He was health minister and then foreign minister of a notoriously repressive regime in Ethiopia, where Beijing has been a major investor for years.
Whatever the reasons for Mr. Tedros’s romance with China’s commissars, we know the results. The WHO’s binge of lying for China began with its statements last winter implying that Beijing on Dec. 31 had diligently notified the WHO of the Wuhan outbreak. As it later turned out, China had sent no such notice and was trying to hide the outbreak by silencing Wuhan’s doctors. The WHO learned of the new disease from such sources as a medical website based in the U.S. and an email from Taiwan, where authorities were worried about the SARS-like potential for contagion—a message the WHO quietly sidelined.
During the critical early weeks of the Wuhan outbreak, the WHO played it down, delayed the release of information, and lied outright to make Beijing look good. While Mr. Tedros was lauding China’s “transparency,” thanking China’s President Xi Jinping for his “very rare leadership” and praising Beijing as “setting a new standard for outbreak response,” the disease was spilling out of China. In early February, Mr. Tedros told the WHO executive board there was no need for international travel bans because the chances of the virus spreading from China were “very low.” By March 11, when he finally sounded the overdue alarm of a global pandemic, the virus had arrived in at least 118 countries.
By now, Covid-19 has infected more than 55 million people world-wide, killed more than 1.3 million, blitzed the world economy, and stirred political tumult. Still Mr. Tedros goes on shilling for Beijing. At a (virtual) meeting of the World Health Assembly in May, the WHO’s member states called for an investigation into the origin and handling of the pandemic. In July Mr. Tedros packed an “independent” inquiry with Beijing acolytes, who are proving slow and incurious. 
Last week a Geneva-based monitoring group, UN Watch, called for the resignation of one of the panel co-chairmen tapped by Mr. Tedros, former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, “on account of her numerous prior statements praising the WHO’s response, and due to her close ties with the Chinese government.”
At Beijing’s behest, Mr. Tedros has excluded Taiwan from WHO proceedings, though it’s within his authority to invite Taiwan as an observer, as it was from 2009-16. That changed as Mr. Xi took China in a more totalitarian direction, and Taiwan in 2016 elected President Tsai Ing-wen, a staunch defender of its freedom. Beijing’s response included a May 2017 written statement to all international organizations in Geneva, notably the WHO, informing them: “China decides that Taiwan Province of China shall not participate in the [World Health Assembly] this year” and urging them to “remain vigilant” against any approach by Taiwan, meaning “no contact, no communication in any form.” It appears these have been Beijing’s marching orders ever since, and Mr. Tedros has complied.
That explains why the WHO disregarded Taiwan’s early warning about the Wuhan outbreak. While the WHO was relaying China’s false reassurances to the world, Taiwan turned immediately to travel screening, contact tracing and targeted quarantines, and with a population of 23.5 million has recorded fewer than 650 cases and only seven deaths from Covid-19.
Not that Mr. Tedros has entirely ignored Taiwan. Having styled himself as the voice of global “solidarity” and ignored China’s bigoted treatment of black Africans residing in its borders during the Covid-19 outbreak, Mr. Tedros at an April 8 WHO press conference singled out Taiwan for attack, alleging that Taiwan authorities were behind racist messages he said he’d received online. He provided no evidence, and President Tsai denied the charge.
Mr. Tedros’s WHO contract says he can be fired with six months’ notice. Thanks to Mr. Trump’s withdrawal, the U.S. wields unusual leverage. Under the protracted WHO withdrawal process, America is still a member, with a seat on the WHO executive board, through mid-2021. As chief donor to the WHO since its inception, the U.S., if it returns, would resume contributing roughly $450 million a year, plus substantial expertise and technical support. If the WHO has any integrity left, inviting Taiwan’s participation and waving off Mr. Tedros to a comfortable retirement would be a healthy price to pay for America’s return.

2020/11/18,How Republicans Kept Texas Red,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-republicans-kept-texas-red-11605740783,"Democrats seemed to do everything right to turn Texas blue this year. Joe Biden won 5,211,406 votes, 1.3 million more than Hillary Clinton in 2016 and 1.9 million more than President Obama in 2012. The Democrats’ Senate candidate this year, M.J. Hegar, received the second-highest vote total ever for a Democrat in Texas: 4,844,433.
Democrats also mounted well-funded campaigns to flip six Texas congressional seats, outraising Republicans $28 million to $17 million. Anticipating a 2022 gubernatorial bid, Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke ran the Democrats’ registration and turnout efforts. 
Even more astonishing, Mr. Obama and his former attorney general, Eric Holder, led an effort to mobilize a galaxy of outside groups against a dozen Republican state representatives, aiming to take control of the Texas House by defeating at least nine. These groups spent $61 million.
It all came to nothing. President Trump received 5,860,096 votes, 1.2 million more than four years ago, and beat Mr. Biden by 648,690. Though Sen. John Cornyn was outspent late in the race, he defeated Ms. Hegar by more than one million votes. Republicans kept those six congressional seats, most by big margins, and Messrs. Obama and Holder didn’t win the Democrats any new state House seats, leaving the GOP majority intact for next year’s redistricting.
Democrats did what they needed to do: increase their turnout dramatically. Give them credit. But it wasn’t nearly enough, as Republicans did even better. How did Republicans do it?
First, with no public fanfare, Republicans undertook two big voter-registration drives. One, which I helped run, used big data, technology and volunteers from the Texas Federation of Republican Women, College Republicans and county GOP organizations. Mr. Cornyn lent a wily former state GOP chairman, Steve Munisteri, to travel Texas stirring up volunteers and enthusiasm while the program’s director, Mitch Carney, led an effort that added 212,972 new Republicans to the voter rolls—at a cost of $7.90 each. The other effort, by the super PAC Engage Texas, used traditional methods, hiring nearly 200 workers to stand outside Department of Motor Vehicles offices and knock on doors. Before it was shut down by Covid-19, it registered another 105,697 Republicans at a cost of $70.10 each.
The combined total of 318,669 new Republicans would constitute almost half of Mr. Trump’s statewide margin of victory and one-third of Mr. Cornyn’s. But both efforts focused on key congressional and state House districts. In one congressional seat and at least four state House races, the numbers of new in-district Republican registrations were more than the winning GOP candidate’s margin.
Second, Texas Republicans mounted a big get-out-the-vote operation. Mr. Cornyn benefited from such efforts when he was elected a state Supreme Court justice in 1990 and state attorney general in 1998. Last year he directed his campaign manager, John Jackson, and Mr. Munisteri to re-create such an effort for this fall. They picked a young operative, Spencer Davis, to run it.
The Texas Victory Committee used microtargeting to identify low-propensity voters who needed extra encouragement to turn out, as well as swing suburban voters (especially women) and persuadable Hispanics. Mr. Davis’s staff of 40 worked with an army of volunteers to canvass 1.3 million doors, complete 3.1 million calls, and send 24.1 million text messages, supported by seven million pieces of mail, including slate mailers to encourage Republicans to vote for down-ballot offices, since Texas recently abolished straight-ticket voting. This totals 35.5 million voter contacts.
Third, Republican messaging was strong. Texas Republicans pummeled Democrats over their radical agenda: higher taxes, attacks on fracking and oil and gas, a federal takeover of health care, repeal of the state’s right-to-work law, and flirtation with socialism and defunding the police. The Cornyn campaign used Ms. Hegar’s declaration that “what Democrats need to do differently is not compromise and not become moderate” to show she was a left-winger. GOP candidates for the House and the state Legislature also made use of their opponents’ ultraliberal views.
State House Republicans found they could run on their records, pointing to increases in teacher pay and school funding, protections for pre-existing conditions and an end to surprise medical billing, property-tax reform, mandatory jail time for human and sex trafficking and a state constitutional amendment, approved last session, to ban a state income tax. The state’s popular GOP governor, Greg Abbott, reinforced this message, campaigning for state House candidates and putting an unprecedented $6 million into their races.
In short, Texas Republicans took the election seriously, returned to basic blocking and tackling, emphasized a winning conservative message, and contrasted it with the increasingly left-wing views of Texas Democrats. The result was a huge increase in turnout among targeted groups and a GOP win. Texas became even redder.

2020/11/18,"Hey, Trumpians, Cheer Up!",Wonder Land,https://www.wsj.com/articles/hey-trumpians-cheer-up-11605740673,"Pessimism is to conservative politics what pumpkin pie is to Thanksgiving: It’s always on the table. Not long ago about this time of year, liberals would post articles with titles such as, “How to talk to your Uncle Jim at Thanksgiving.” Those pieces had one valid premise—that Uncle Jim would say over his turkey that the world is going to hell, yet again. And on the evidence around some tables, Uncle Jim was right. 
In that grumbling spirit, let many of us who are to the right of the 2020 edition of Joe Biden admit that in the runup to the election, we thought a left-wing idiocracy was about to sweep into power. More than a few arch-pessimists believed the curtain was finally falling on Ben Franklin’s warning that the U.S. is “a republic, if you can keep it.” 

At the risk of arousing the dark side, we are here to posit that the 2020 election results are reason for optimism. (For those who disallow optimism on principle, the diminished election expectations of the Democratic left offer the consolation of schadenfreude.)
Let me count the ways. 
Some thought the Senate next year might have a Democratic majority of 54-46, a wipeout. You knew something was up election night when Maine’s “vulnerable” Susan Collins wasn’t swept into the Atlantic. Then Iowa’s Joni Ernst won, as did North Carolina’s Thom Tillis. It will take Republican (or presidential) malfeasance to lose the Senate deciders in Georgia Jan. 5.
After the Democrats rolled up House seats in the 2018 midterms, they expected to ride an anti-Trump wave to a bigger majority. But their majority narrowed, and the tides of history look likely in 2022 to push Nancy Pelosi into retirement. Two years into Barack Obama’s first term, the Democrats lost 63 House seats. They shed 54 seats in Bill Clinton’s first midterms. By all means, the Democrats should push BidenCare. 
Mrs. Pelosi has explained away the Republican House gains as the result of President Trump at the top of the ticket. A more fine-grained explanation would look at intriguing efforts such as New York GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik’s E-PAC project to recruit Republican women this year. 
Ms. Stefanik hit it out of the park. Notable winners over Democratic incumbents include Michelle Fischbach in Minnesota, Nancy Mace (a Citadel graduate) in South Carolina, California’s Young Kim and New York City’s Nicole Malliotakis. 
Add to the success of these Republican women the crossover to the GOP of black, Hispanic and Asian voters. Democrats argue these gains are small. But the opening for the political optimism of Reaganesque (now Trumpian) private-sector job opportunity is too big to ignore. 
Conventional wisdom holds, with reason, that the Republican Party is a dodo bird in California and New York. But Democrats lost House seats to the dodos in both states. 
The strongest evidence that the GOP won’t be spending a generation in any post-Trumpian wilderness is the National Conference of State Legislatures’ map of partisan legislative control. It shows a lot of red now, notably total control in four states where the Democrats hoped to flip at least one chamber—Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina—as well as such important battlegrounds as Georgia, Ohio, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and New Hampshire. 
Many of these Republican legislatures will be drawing congressional district maps next year. New York and California will each lose a House seat, the latter for the first time ever. 
Yes, refugees from California and New York are turning states like Arizona and Georgia bluer, a story for another time. But speaking of refugees, if you can find one from Eastern Europe who voted for Joe Biden, let me know. Those I talked to from Albania and Romania (and as reported from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba) couldn’t fathom how anyone would vote for “socialism.” Somehow these immigrant voters didn’t get the party’s memo that Mr. Biden isn’t a socialist.
But then, what is he? A moderate with socialist tendencies? 
It’s hard not to notice that the Democratic Party is having an identity crisis at the precise moment “identity politics” is ascendant. The left-wing Justice Democrats have warned the Biden team it risks fracturing the party if it makes “corporate friendly” appointments. 
The second-biggest story of the 2016 election was socialist Bernie Sanders’s strong primary challenge to Hillary Clinton. In defeat, Mr. Sanders became a darling of that swath of the media committed to opening a path to power for the progressive movement by contributing free publicity for its economic and cultural goals. 
Maybe it’s time to consider that the media’s moralistic biases can backfire. After absorbing the progressive policies elevated during the 2020 Democratic primaries and then the content and tactics of the post-May street protests, it looks as if America’s voters, apart from their one-off presidential decision, decided to give the Democratic Party a timeout. 
What happens next with Donald Trump is beyond human understanding. But the 2020 election results in toto have given the party a historic opportunity—if it can keep it.

2020/11/18,Gretchen Whitmer Strikes Again,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/gretchen-whitmer-strikes-again-11605740283,"Rule by executive fiat in the states has become a hallmark of the pandemic, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer seems determined to push its limits. After a rebuke by the state Supreme Court, the Democrat has found a new statutory justification to continue her arbitrary emergency rule of one.
Michigan’s Emergency Management Act gives the Governor some emergency authority but requires legislative approval beyond 28 days. In October the state Supreme Court found Ms. Whitmer exceeded her authority by declaring a new emergency “for the identical reasons” after time ran out on the first one. 
The court also struck down Michigan’s Emergency Powers of the Governor Act, saying that even amid a pandemic “the sheer magnitude of the authority in dispute, as well as its concentration in a single individual, simply cannot be sustained within our constitutional system of separated powers.” 
The state Supreme Court stated that its decision “leaves open many avenues for the Governor and Legislature to work together to address this challenge and we hope that this will take place.“ Instead, her Administration issued a new shutdown order on Nov. 15 and cited the Public Health Code, which gives the Department of Health and Human Services broad authority to “prohibit the gathering of people for any purpose” during an epidemic. The new restrictions mirror some of Ms. Whitmer’s edicts last spring.
The order lasts through Dec. 8, though nothing prevents the Whitmer Administration from extending it. The order prohibits indoor dining and effectively shuts down restaurants again, since few dine outside in a Michigan winter. Indoor gatherings at private residences are limited to no more than two households and no more than 10 people. Michiganders can go to a museum but not a movie theater or ice skating rink. The list of arbitrary restrictions goes on, and anyone who violates it risks fines or jail time. 
Ms. Whitmer’s office did not respond to our request for comment. But the health agency’s director, Robert Gordon said that “the order rests firmly on epidemic powers given to the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services after the Spanish Flu a century ago, and it is lawful.” We’ll see about that. 
On Tuesday two restaurant owners and the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association, which represents more than 5,000 restaurants in the state, filed suit in federal court. They claim the emergency order denies restaurant owners’ due process and constitutes an unlawful taking of their property. 
The suit says that proprietors of restaurants, cafes, bars and breweries “have lost the ability to use their real and personal property in any meaningful economically beneficial manner,” and they “have no adequate remedy at law for this continuing violation of their constitutional rights.” The complaint notes that some 2,000 establishments have already closed for good, and some 6,000 may soon follow if the restrictions aren’t lifted.
Instead of issuing a blanket ban on gatherings as the Public Health Code allows, the lawsuit claims, the health department has imposed “capricious, sporadic and selective regulations” that “irrationally single out restaurants and bars while permitting other non-essential businesses to offer indoor services.” This amounts to “improper, unconstitutional lawmaking” by the Whitmer Administration, the complaint suggests. The same pick-and-choose restrictions may also constitute an equal protection violation.
Americans have peaceably accepted coercive limits on their daily life that they couldn’t have imagined nine months ago. Yet a pandemic doesn’t negate the Constitution. As Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito said last week, the longer emergency powers are in use, the more they become questionable under the law. The bars may be closed, but too many governors are drunk on power. Perhaps federal courts can sober them up.

2020/11/18,"Happy Birthday, Joe",Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/happy-birthday-joe-11605740244,"Seventy-eight candles on a birthday cake is an achievement in longevity for anyone, and Joe Biden earns the flames-and-frosting trophy this Friday. As Mr. Biden and his partygoers prepare to take over the White House, here’s a wish for four years of good health. 
America’s oldest President to date, Ronald Reagan, was three weeks shy of 78 when he left the Oval Office for the last time. The second oldest President, Donald Trump, will be 74 1/2 on Jan. 20. From there, the record drops to roughly age 70 for Dwight Eisenhower and Andrew Jackson. Harry Truman and George H.W. Bush departed at not-quite 69.
Mr. Biden’s term won’t expire until he’s 82, so he has a special duty to be forthright about his health. Last year Mr. Biden’s campaign released a three-page doctor’s note on his medical history. Entries included high cholesterol, acid reflux, seasonal allergies and non-valvular atrial fibrillation, a kind of irregular heart rhythm, though it was “completely asymptomatic” and didn’t require treatment.
The letter briefly listed Mr. Biden’s surgery in 1988 to repair a hemorrhage from a brain aneurysm. A scan in 2014 “showed no recurrence.” He’s had “several localized, non-melanoma skin cancers removed,” and he is under “close dermatologic surveillance.”
A “recent” echocardiogram showed “no signs of heart failure.” He doesn’t drink alcohol but “works out at least five days per week.” The doctor concluded that Mr. Biden “is a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.”
How about cognitive health or testing? Mr. Biden has bristled at the question, saying he’s “constantly tested” in the campaign. But spend a few minutes watching Mr. Biden in 2012, browbeating Paul Ryan during that year’s vice presidential debate. He was aggressive and confident. In 2020, in the rare times he speaks off the cuff without a teleprompter, he looks more tentative, as if grasping for an argument or words that he knows are around here somewhere.
It doesn’t take a tinfoil hat to wonder if Mr. Biden might be losing his fastball, not that there would be any shame in it at age 78. In any case, voters have given him the job. With any luck Mr. Biden will blow out birthday candles for many years to come. But as the oldest President ever, his cognitive condition will be a frequent source of speculation, and he should be transparent. President Trump’s critics said his health disclosures were inadequate, and fair enough. Mr. Biden has a chance to do better.

2020/11/18,Amazon Shakes Up Health Care,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-shakes-up-health-care-11605740211,"Amazon has driven innovation and competition across the retail industry from supermarkets to books. Now it’s gunning for pharmacies, which could force healthy changes across America’s sclerotic health-care system.
On Tuesday the retail and cloud-computing giant announced it is launching an online pharmacy that will deliver common medications, including insulin and asthma inhalers, with free two-day shipping for its Prime members. The move was facilitated by its purchase two years ago of PillPack, the online pharmacy startup that sorts, packages and delivers medication.
PillPack came with licenses to operate in 49 states, as well as technology and logistical infrastructure that Amazon has further developed. Amazon’s success in the highly regulated prescription drug market is by no means guaranteed. But its entrance has made muscular incumbents take notice and raise their game. CVS and Walgreens now offer fast and free prescription drug delivery. 
Retail pharmacies have been also been adding services in their stores to increase value for customers. CVS has expanded its MinuteClinics that provide urgent care and is launching 1,500 HealthHUBs that offer screenings and blood tests for chronic conditions. 
Walmart is launching health-care clinics that provide primary and dental care and psychiatric counseling with low out-of-pocket costs. Fees for primary-care visits are a flat $40. Customers can get lab services and medical imaging on site. Walgreens this summer also announced plans to attach 500 to 700 full-service doctors’ offices to its stores over the next five years.
Pharmacy clinics have been helping test and treat for Covid-19, and they will be even more important in rolling out vaccines. Their expansion is also providing competition for large hospital networks that have consolidated market share by acquiring physician practices and have contributed to higher health-care costs. 
Clinics can provide less expensive care by employing physician assistants, nurse practitioners and even pharmacists to treat uncomplicated problems and chronic conditions. Medical cartels have tried to protect their turf, but one hope is that the combined might of the large pharmacies and Amazon can push state lawmakers to relax regulatory barriers to competition.
PillPack, for instance, has pushed changes in states that would let pharmacy technicians transfer medications from other pharmacies. Like other pharmacies, Amazon will have to negotiate with pharmaceutical benefit managers that set pharmacy reimbursements, drug formularies and out-of-pocket costs for insurance plans. But Amazon’s heft may reduce the market power of the large PBMs and could even create more transparency in drug prices.
It’s hard to predict how health-care markets will evolve in response to Amazon’s entrance, but increased competition will no doubt produce benefits for consumers. And while Amazon’s critics often complain about its size, its main competitors in health care aren’t exactly pipsqueaks.

2020/11/18,Will Boris Tax Britain to Death?,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-boris-tax-britain-to-death-11605740127,"If you thought the coronavirus lockdowns were bad for economies, wait until you see how governments pay for their relief spending. The United Kingdom is offering an early glimpse, and the results aren’t pretty.
A major debate about tax policy is breaking out as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak reckon with the 20%-of-GDP hole that pandemic relief has blown in the budget. No responsible government can long ignore a deficit of that magnitude, but a more realistic government would focus on growing its way out. This would involve ending the draconian and ineffective national lockdown, and then using strategic tax and regulatory reforms to stimulate investment and job creation.
Mr. Sunak instead is looking at raising taxes. One proposal in a report from the government’s Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) would raise capital-gains tax rates nearer to the rates on personal income. The target supposedly is carried interest in the private-equity and hedge-fund industries, where returns from investments are taxed at a capital-gains rate of 28% rather than the 45% income-tax rate for highly paid firm partners.
Private-equity firms make an inviting political target, but the media focus on carried interest obscures all the other forms of capital gain on which the OTS suggests harmonizing tax rates with the income tax. That includes the equity that entrepreneurs build up in small businesses. Anyone who thinks the U.K. would prosper by adopting the highest capital-gains tax rate in the developed world—and by doing so right after Brexit—has been in lockdown too long. 
Meanwhile, the center-left Resolution Foundation is giving Mr. Sunak bad ideas. One is taxing the “excess” profits arising from the pandemic, such as those earned by supermarkets and online retailers. 
It also wants an income-tax hike up and down the income distribution—including a freeze on the standard exemption and current brackets so that inflation lifts more middle-income taxpayers into higher tax rates. The think tank is right that a threshold freeze would be easier to sneak past voters than an outright tax increase, which is why there’s a risk the government could embrace this approach.
Some people see the danger. The center-right Centre for Policy Studies and the U.S.-based Tax Foundation recently released their tax plan for Britain, in which they focus more on business investment and economic growth than higher taxes. Their ideas, such as rationalizing property taxes for businesses and implementing 100% expensing for capital expenditure, are Britain’s best hope of boosting revenue by stimulating investment and hiring. Alas, that’s not the mood Britain’s politicians are in at the moment. 
The conspicuous feature of these revenue raisers is that they lean heavily on the middle class. Yes, even the capital-gains proposals. The kerfuffle over private-equity carried interest obscures how little revenue is at stake—around £420 million a year, if no investors decamp from the U.K. If they do, the tax will raise less. Mr. Sunak has spent hundreds of billions of pounds on pandemic relief.
The OTS report also suggests such anti-middle-class proposals as reducing exemptions for the capital gains that arise when an entrepreneur starts a successful small business. And the report suggests reducing the tax-exempt threshold for gains to as low as £2,000 from the current £12,300. This would ensnare thousands of middle-class taxpayers, and it’s where the real money is in a capital-gains tax heist because these taxpayers are less mobile.
The political left is at least honest that there isn’t enough revenue to be raised from one-off levies on big companies or green taxes to fill the fiscal chasm the pandemic has opened. The Resolution Foundation notes the main impact of these proposals is political—they make the accompanying middle-class tax hikes more palatable.
That makes Britain’s tax debate very similar to what’s emerging in the U.S., especially as progressives claim that taxing the rich, or fossil fuels, or something else will be enough to pay the government’s bills. They won’t come close, and their real point is to disguise the hit on the middle class. America, you’ve been warned.

2020/11/18,About Those Trump Vaccine Predictions,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/about-those-trump-vaccine-predictions-11605738468,"“Public-private partnership” is usually a Beltway term for cronyism and the waste of taxpayer resources. But so far it’s hard to argue with the results of the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed to assist the development and distribution of medical innovations to address Covid-19. The rapid results must be especially striking to news consumers who were repeatedly told that the president was wrong in predicting quick development of a vaccine.
Back in August, Jane C. Timm and Jane Weaver of NBC News reported on the President’s Republican convention speech:
Thank goodness these “fact checkers” didn’t have a firm grasp of the facts. The Journal’s Jared Hopkins reports today:
As for therapies, Mr. Hopkins notes:
And of course Pfizer’s new innovation is not the only vaccine showing great promise. The Journal’s Peter Loftus reported on Monday:
The Moderna news arrived exactly two weeks after the Atlantic magazine’s publication of an article titled “All the President’s Lies About the Coronavirus: An unfinished compendium of Trump’s overwhelming dishonesty during a national emergency.” Author Christian Paz included on his dubious list moments when Mr. Trump said a vaccine would be ready “soon” and also a comment Mr. Trump made on September 29: 
There’s an old saying in the newspaper business: No one ever gets fired for calling President Trump a liar. Actually that’s not an old saying, but it should give the media industry’s “fact checkers” comfort that certain mistakes may be tolerated more than others. 
The Washington Post has a regular column called “Fact Checker” and an edition published the same day as the Atlantic piece is also not aging gracefully. The Posties wrote:
What would we do without experts? In this season of thanks we can all be grateful that Mr. Trump was pushing them to exceed the usual glacial pace of Washington’s health bureaucracies. A recent Journal editorial noted:
Don’t be surprised if the media’s “fact checkers” now attempt to explain away their erroneous and unfair coverage by saying that they simply meant that even if a vaccine was developed it would still take a long time to distribute. 
Mr. Trump’s program could soon be taking away that excuse, too. Keith Zubrow of CBS News recently reported on Gen. Gustave Perna, the career U.S. Army supply officer appointed to lead Operation Warp Speed. The general’s team has been stockpiling supplies of several vaccine candidates awaiting FDA approval. According to Mr. Zubrow:
Whether or not “fact checkers” ever acknowledge it, the rapid pace of vaccine development predicted by the president is a benefit to people everywhere.

2020/11/18,Masks Aren’t Perfect but Help in Proper Use,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/masks-arent-perfect-but-help-in-proper-use-11605737917,"In “Case for Mask Mandate Rests on Bad Data” (op-ed, Nov. 12), Phillip W. Magness fundamentally misses the point of the Covid-19 forecasting conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. His argument hinges on the mask-wearing rate we use to create Covid-19 projections. He is correct that our estimate of mask-wearing rates has increased as we have incorporated new data into our model. He is incorrect to suggest that this weakens the case for public policies that require masks. As a cheap, widely accessible, effective intervention, masks can and should be our first line of defense against the pandemic, which is rising to dangerous levels in many states across the country, threatening lives, jobs and businesses. 
Today’s IHME modeling shows that if 95% of U.S. residents were to wear masks when leaving home, we could prevent the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans over the winter months. The course of the epidemic isn’t cast in stone. It depends critically on the choices we make today. The message from our modeling, which correctly predicted the current surge months ago, is clear: Masks work, and much deeper pain is ahead if we refuse to wear them.

The most common transmitter of germs between humans is the hand. When you are five feet away from others, aerosol transmission dominates. That’s why you wear a mask. The only respondents in a survey that can be counted as compliant are those that say they “always” wear masks when they leave their house. We have no way of knowing the circumstances in which the “almost always” mask wearers weren’t compliant. They may have been at marches or wild parties. The virus doesn’t care. It is opportunistic. Mr. Magness’s acceptance of “almost always” as equivalent to “always” makes his argument irrelevant.
Howard Winet
Berkeley, Calif.
A meta-analysis of 172 mask-effectiveness and distancing studies published in the Lancet (June 1) clearly found masks to be significantly effective. 
Everyone should have noticed, or at least remembered, that mask nonwearing in the Trump campaign led to far more Covid-19 positives than in the mask-wearing Biden campaign. 
Are there any dentists today not using a mask or face guard? Why is there so much antipathy toward masks? 
Arthur E. Sowers, Ph.D.
Harbeson, Del.
Mr. Magness misses the opportunity to offer insights into why we are seeing 150,000 new cases a day if mask wearing is as widely accepted and employed as he suggests. 
Prof. Glenn Melnick 
University of Southern California
Los Angeles
Mask wearing needs to be better considered by context. Is the value of wearing a mask in a busy local market the same as wearing one while on a hike in the woods or on a windy beach? I doubt it. Risks associated with not wearing a mask must be defined by context-specific data that emphasizes proximity to others—the social density factor—like being on a crowded bus or subway.

2020/11/18,Bring Our Troops Home From Afghanistan,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bring-our-troops-home-from-afghanistan-11605737796,"Regarding your editorial “Rush for the Afghan Exits?” (Nov. 16): I was a Marine fighter pilot who was one of the first to fight in the American Afghan war 19 years ago. I flew my first mission less than one month after the 9/11 attacks. Along with my fellow USS Theodore Roosevelt aviators we toppled the Taliban and decimated the al Qaeda leadership. I thought the war was near its end when our ship returned in the spring of 2002. Today, Americans are still on Afghanistan’s soil.
I have lost close friends in Afghanistan. Every day I think of their widows and children left fatherless. They did their duty. Now it’s time for our civilian leadership to do its duty and bring our troops home. 
Candidate Barack Obama promised to do this, but as president he escalated foreign involvement manyfold in many places. President Trump is actually ending endless wars. I applaud his efforts and his commitment to bringing every last one of our troops home from Afghanistan. I hope and pray they are with their families for Christmas—safe and sound. Most Americans still can’t find Afghanistan on a map. After 19 years our National Command Authority has yet to clearly state our mission in Afghanistan.

2020/11/18,Trump’s Covid Policy Has Been Reasonable,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-covid-policy-has-been-reasonable-11605737616,"Prof. Howard Forman’s recounting of how President Trump handled Covid-19 is some type of dystopian dream (“There Really Is No Biden Covid-19 Fairy Tale,” Letters, Nov. 5). He states that the president didn’t deliver testing or protective equipment, yet the U.S. has more tests per million than any country, and President Trump pushed U.S. companies to produce PPE when he found the Obama-Biden administration left the storage bin bare and let China produce almost all supplies. President Trump didn’t warn about the virus? Did the professor miss the daily Covid briefings with health experts? And, the president didn’t undermine regulatory authorities working on the virus, he streamlined the regulatory process. 
Prof. Forman says Joe Biden’s plan of masks, distance, testing and restoring vaccine faith is the answer, all things president Trump is doing. When Democrats say that the president caused many unnecessary deaths, they ignore the rise of the virus in Europe along with a deaths-per-million rate similar to the U.S. But never mentioned is how many deaths a Biden administration might have caused by not closing travel from China, with harsher shutdowns and by only listening to health experts instead of acting to consider other societal interests.

2020/11/19,A Bogus Dispute Is Doing Real Damage,Declarations,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-bogus-dispute-is-doing-real-damage-11605832051,"No hard evidence of widespread fraud, no success in the courts or prospect of it. You can have a theory that a bad thing was done, but only facts will establish it. You need to do more than what Rudy Giuliani did at his news conference Thursday, which was throw out huge, barely comprehensible allegations and call people “crooks.” You need to do more than Sidney Powell, who, at the same news conference, charged that “communist money” is behind an international conspiracy to rig the U.S. election. There was drama, hyperbole, perhaps madness. But the wilder the charges, the more insubstantial the case appeared.
More than two weeks after the election, it’s clear where this is going. The winner will be certified and acknowledged; Joe Biden will be inaugurated. But it’s right to worry about the damage being done on the journey.
It’s one thing when supporters of the president say, simply, “Let’s go through the process and see where we are.” It’s not bad to look into how messy the voting system is, not the worst to realize it needs long-term remedial attention. How did we devolve into a nation that no longer has an election night but an election month?
But the sheer nuttiness surrounding the current mess is becoming deeply destructive. Online you see the websites read by millions saying the entire election system is shot through with criminality. The headlines read: It was stolen. We have proof of coordinated vote tampering. The president has many avenues to victory. The Trump campaign sent an email under the name of formerly respectable Republican Newt Gingrich, once speaker of the House, saying “The Corruption is Unprecedented”: “It’s time for us to get MAD.” We can’t “roll over.” “Please contribute $45 RIGHT NOW to the Official Election Defense Fund.”
This isn’t a game. America isn’t your plaything. Doesn’t Mr. Gingrich realize how dangerous it is to stoke people like this, to rev them up on the idea that holding even the slightest faith in the system is for suckers? 
Trump staff and supporters should know at this point that in trying to change the outcome they are doing harm—undercutting respect in and hope for democracy. Republican senators and representatives, in their silence, are allowing the idea to take hold that the whole system is rigged. This lessens faith in institutions and in their party’s reputation. Republicans were once protective of who we are and what we created in this democratic republic long ago. 
Now they’re not even protecting themselves; in future years what’s happening now will give their voters an excuse not to take part or show up. What’s the point? It’s all rigged. 
And they are accepting a new postelection precedent, that national results won’t be accepted until all states are certified and all legal options, even the most bizarre and absurd, exhausted. Wait until this is used against you, in 2024 or ’28. You won’t like it.
I found myself thinking this week of the 1960s and the John Birch Society, which had some power in its day as an anticommunist movement whose core belief was that officials of the U.S. government were conspiring with international communism to take down America. They were pretty wild. In time they accused Dwight D. Eisenhower, president of the United States and hero of Normandy, of being a secret communist agent. 

Rising conservative leaders, embarrassed by the Birchers, didn’t wish to see their movement tainted. They also didn’t want to alienate voters who sympathized with the Birchers: Every movement has its nuts. Russell Kirk, Barry Goldwater and William F. Buckley pushed back, the last calling the head of the society, Robert Welch, “far removed from common sense.” Even Ayn Rand joined in: Thinking the country’s woes were due to a communist conspiracy “is childishly naive and superficial.” Anyway, “they are not for capitalism but merely against communism.” 
The John Birch Society faded because all these conservative leaders, and more, sort of congealed and took the larger weight of their movement in other directions. And so modern conservatism was born as pretty much a healthy movement, and not pretty much a sick one.
I’ve been thinking about all this because of the question: What would have happened if the John Birch Society had been online, if it had existed in the internet age when accusations, dark warnings and violent talk can rip through a country in a millisecond and anonymous voices can whip things up for profit or pleasure?
It wouldn’t have faded. It would have prospered. 
We’ve all decried this aspect of the internet for 20 years; our alarm about its ability to enable and encourage extremism is so old, we forget to keep feeling it. But we’ll look back on this time as one in which the least responsible among us shook big foundations. 
Responsible Republican leaders ought to congeal and address the fact that what rough faith and trust we have in the system is being damaged. Which means our ability to proceed as a healthy democracy is being damaged. 
There is no realistic route to victory for the president, only to confusion and chaos and undermining. He is not going to find the votes in recounts to win the election. Dominion, the voting-machine company under attack, has not been credibly charged with doing anything wrong. As the Journal said this week in an editorial, “Strong claims need strong proof, not rumors and innuendo on Twitter. ”
The irony is that this election will be remembered for the president’s attempts to sow chaos, not for what it actually appears to have been, which is a triumph for America. In the middle of a pandemic, with new rules, there was historically high turnout. Under stress the system worked. Voters were committed, trusting, and stood in line for hours. There was no violence at the polls, no serious charges of voter suppression. In a time of legitimate hacking fears, there were no reports of foreign interference. Our defenses held. On top of all that, the outcome was moderate: for all the strife and stress of recent years, the split decision amounted to a reassertion of centrism.
You’d think the president would take his winnings and go home, because he had them. He outperformed polls and exceeded his 2016 vote total by more than 10 million. For one brief shining moment, on Nov. 3, he’d finally expanded his base to almost 50% of the electorate. He found new sources of support. 
Imagine if he’d acted even remotely normal in his first term, if he’d had the intellectual, emotional and spiritual resources to moderate himself, to act respectably. Heck, imagine if he’d worn a mask. He might have won.
He is set on going out like a villain. He and his people would find this Jacksonian—he’s refusing to bow to entrenched establishments! He would think this is what his base wants—the old battler refusing to accept the illicit judgments of a decadent elite. 
If he were clever and disciplined, he’d do it differently. He’d accept the election’s outcome, if not graciously at least with finality, go home to Mar-a-Lago, play golf, and have fun torturing his party by plotting his return. “I’ll be back.” 
Instead he leaves behind real and politically pointless ruin.

2020/11/19,A Global Covid Vaccine Heist,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-global-covid-vaccine-heist-11605829343,"Breakthroughs on vaccines and new treatments are finally offering the world a path to end the Covid-19 pandemic. They’re a tribute to private U.S. corporate innovation, but now developing countries led by India and South Africa are making a damaging bid to waive patent protections for these life-saving advances. 
The attempt will surface Friday when these countries offer a resolution at the World Trade Organization meeting to waive patent protections for Covid vaccines, therapies and other technologies. They say this is needed to ensure poor countries have equal access, but their effort would harm everyone, including the poor.
“There are several reports about intellectual property rights hindering or potentially hindering timely provisioning of affordable medical products,” India and South Africa wrote last month in a WTO proposal that has drawn support from Pakistan, Argentina and Venezuela. America’s left and many nonprofit activists are backing the resolution.
Their complaint is that wealthy countries have locked up most of the world’s vaccine supply next year and are hoarding virus therapies and diagnostic tests. They want the WTO to grant free and unrestricted access to the intellectual property of private companies. Otherwise, they warn, the global pandemic will continue to rage.
This is a false choice. Private companies in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe, with the financial support of their governments, have produced most virus breakthroughs. The Trump Administration’s Operation Warp Speed has spent more than $10 billion to advance vaccine clinical trials, manufacturing and distribution.
The U.S. government has also agreed to compensate private companies for vaccines and therapies in return for obtaining the earliest available dosages. For instance, the feds have allocated $1.5 billion to support the manufacturing and delivery of Moderna's vaccine candidate in return for 100 million initial doses. America’s taxpayers have essentially paid for early access.
Nonetheless, companies plan to share the fruits of their investment and innovation with the world’s poor. A World Health Organization initiative funded by wealthy countries has reserved 450 million vaccine doses for 92 developing countries with populations of 3.9 billion. Gilead has voluntarily agreed to license its antiviral remdesivir royalty-free to developing countries.
Many companies are willing to license their IP at low or even no cost but want contractual agreements to ensure it is developed safely and not pilfered. But India and South Africa want to obtain this technology without paying for it and then use their generic-drug manufacturing base to produce, distribute and sell copycats worldwide. 
This is theft, not sharing. Vitiating patents will stifle innovation and make it harder to end this pandemic and the next one. It’s not clear developing countries even have the ability to manufacture large-scale, complex technologies like Moderna’s mRNA vaccine or Eli Lilly’s monoclonal antibody cocktail—let alone distribute them. 
The latter requires a strong health-care infrastructure and meticulous planning. Pfizer’s vaccine must be shipped and stored at ultra-cold temperatures. Even if governments of poorer countries were given free life-saving therapies and vaccines, most of their people wouldn’t get immediate access. Unlike the U.S. and Europe, most governments in the developing world also don’t provide liability protection to vaccine makers for adverse side effects. “Manufacturers won’t agree to procurement contracts or ship vaccine without liability protection,” a New England Journal of Medicine article recently explained. 
Europe and the U.S. oppose the patent heist at the WTO, but they may be outnumbered at Friday’s meeting. China seems conflicted. It also wants access to the West’s vaccine technology. But it has developed vaccines of its own that it aims to distribute to poor countries to build goodwill.
Vaccines and therapies aren’t a free global good. They require billions of dollars in investment and years of risk-taking. U.S. companies are willing to share what they’ve developed but their patents deserve protection as an asset that is now helping the world eliminate the Covid scourge.

2020/11/19,A Family Policy Warning,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-family-policy-warning-11605829175," Joe Biden ran on a $775 billion family policy plan including child-care subsidies and paid leave. He likely won’t have the Democratic majorities in Congress to pass the whole thing, but some Republicans have been warming to similar programs. Child care subsidies are a candidate for bipartisan policy agreement in the next administration.
That means these policies deserve scrutiny, and a major study of decades of employment data in Austria provides reasons to doubt some of the extravagant claims made by advocates. Austria’s “enormous expansions of parental leave and child care subsidies have had virtually no impact on gender convergence,” says the study, which is published in the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Most research on long-run gender pay gaps compares outcomes between countries. These five economists—from Princeton, the London School of Economics, Analysis Group, the University of Edinburgh and the University of Zurich—instead sought to isolate the long-run impact of policy changes in a single country. They “rely on exceptional administrative data covering the labor market and birth histories of Austrian workers from 1953 to 2017.”
On average, they find, mothers earn significantly less over the long run than fathers. Women now earn much more than they did decades ago, but the authors analyzed changes in Austria’s paid leave and child-subsidy policies to find that they had little impact. This suggests that “gender convergence relies less on government intervention than on equilibrium features of the labor market” like education levels, as well as “the evolution of gendered preferences and norms,” the authors write.
Some conservatives hope that child-subsidy policies may make couples more likely to have children. Yet this study finds “a very small, and insignificant, negative effect of child care on fertility” in Austria when day-care subsidies were expanded.
All of this suggests that child-rearing decisions are heavily shaped by culture and individual preferences, and moving the dials on social policy likely won’t have the transformative effects that proponents hope. Family benefits are a boon to parents, and it’s encouraging that more U.S. companies are offering them. Yet policy makers should consider their limits before creating expensive and mandated entitlements economy-wide.

2020/11/19,A Missile Defense Triumph,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-missile-defense-triumph-11605829117,"President Trump’s nuclear diplomacy with North Korea ultimately stalled, and there’s little reason to expect Joe Biden will achieve more than his predecessors. This makes the news of a major advance in American missile defense all the more important. 
On Monday a missile interceptor launched from a Navy destroyer successfully brought down a test intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time, according to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. More successful tests will mean another layer of security for America’s missile-defense system, which now targets ICBMs with ground-based interceptors. The U.S. had tested ship-based defenses against missiles with shorter ranges, but not against ICBMs that could reach the U.S. homeland.
Pyongyang is America’s primary concern. The sea-based system could help defend Hawaii, along with other U.S. interests and allies in the Pacific, from a North Korean attack. And the recent advance should raise more doubts in the mind of an attacker that any first strike will succeed.
This is an important time for missile defense. North Korea conducted three ICBM tests in 2017, and it revealed a new long-range missile at a military parade in October. China plans to double its nuclear-warhead stockpile—which includes some designed to fit on ICBMs—over the next decade, according to a Pentagon report published in September. Russia still maintains the world’s largest nuclear arsenal and it blatantly violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces accord that Ronald Reagan struck with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987.
Previously the disarmament left complained that missile defense was an unreliable waste of money. As these systems grow more sophisticated, apparently they’ve become too effective. 
“It is likely to have a crushing effect on prospects for new nuclear arms control agreements,” Laura Grego of the left-wing Union of Concerned Scientiststweeted about this week’s news. Growing missile-defense capabilities “will also provide motivation (or justification) for Russia and China to diversify and grow their nuclear weapons arsenals.” 
An Associated Press dispatch by Robert Burns on the successful test breezed past the benefits of protecting innocent Americans into the same line that defenses somehow make the world less safe. 
The odd logic seems to be that the U.S. shouldn’t defend itself against missiles that countries already have because those countries might build more missiles in response. Vulnerability as a virtue isn’t a doctrine most Americans are likely to find reassuring.
Nuclear anti-proliferation efforts are vital, especially against Iran, North Korea and terrorist groups. But arms-control promises are too easily broken to trust without intrusive verification, and even then countries will cheat, as Russia shows. Progress on missile defense makes Americans and the world safer.

Andrew Cuomo, talking to CNN, described a recent tightening of his Covid-19 regulations. Is it any wonder that religious New Yorkers are now seeking the shelter of the First Amendment?
This week two Orthodox Jewish synagogues, affiliated with the organization Agudath Israel, appealed to the Supreme Court, asking to be freed of Mr. Cuomo’s order limiting houses of worship in certain zones to 10 or 25 people, no matter their normal capacity. The synagogues say they had “carefully and successfully complied” with mask requirements and social-distancing rules, and they’d split the traditional service into “several separate gatherings.”
Yet Mr. Cuomo’s “guilt-by-religious-association restrictions” have now made it “impossible” for them to exercise their faith, their application says. The burden is particularly heavy on the Orthodox, because they “are prohibited from vehicular travel on Saturdays and holidays,” making it impractical for them to “travel to synagogues outside of their restricted zones.”
Mr. Cuomo announced his Covid-19 “cluster” initiative in October, applying it to specific areas, such as in Brooklyn, that the applicants say show “clear gerrymandering to encircle primarily Orthodox communities and synagogues.” They also cite Mr. Cuomo’s comments on a call with Jewish leaders. “This is a fear-driven response,” he said. “You know, this is not a policy being written by a scalpel.” The application went to Justice Stephen Breyer, who has asked New York to reply by Friday.
In a separate appeal filed to Justice Breyer last week, the Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn says Mr. Cuomo’s order “expressly singles out ‘houses of worship’ by that name for adverse treatment relative to secular businesses.” In red zones, the most restricted areas, offices and pet stores can run without capacity limits, because the Governor deems them “essential,” the filing says. In orange zones, “almost all commercial enterprises” can stay open.
How does this pass muster under the First Amendment? The diocese says that its affected churches range in capacity up to 1,200 people. Capping them at 10 or 25 can’t be the least-restrictive way of protecting public health. With safety protocols in place, the filing adds, there is “no evidence of any COVID spread in any of the Diocese’s churches at any time since they reopened.” If other groups are flouting the rules, “the Governor can enforce existing law against the violators.”
New York’s reply says that the capacity limits “are generally applicable and neutral.” Indoor religious gatherings, the filing adds, “commonly possess ‘problematic features’ from an epidemiological perspective,” such as lengthy congregating, mixing of different households, and talking, singing or chanting. The comparable secular activities, the state argues, include concerts and theatrical performances. The state claims it “would have been justified in prohibiting altogether gatherings in houses of worship located in red and orange zones.”
That is some statement. In a speech last week, Justice Samuel Alito called the pandemic “a sort of constitutional stress test,” adding specifically that “in certain quarters, religious liberty is fast becoming a disfavored right.” Here’s a chance to readjust. Pet stores: open. Churches: closed. Those might be New York’s priorities, but they aren’t the Constitution’s.

2020/11/19,When Biden Met Begin,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-biden-met-begin-11605828020," Joe Biden’s three-decade wait for power—he first declared for the presidency in 1987—is remarkable but not without analogue. Menachem Begin spent 29 years trying to become Israel’s prime minister before his surprise 1977 election.
Mr. Biden spent his years in waiting ensconced in the establishment, well-liked by Senate colleagues. As vice president he cemented a reputation for being able to talk and work with the other side. Begin, by contrast, was despised by the socialist elites who dominated Israeli politics. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s founding father, excluded two parties from consideration for coalition agreements: Begin’s Herut (Freedom) Party and the Communists. For years Ben-Gurion wouldn’t even utter Begin’s name in Parliament, referring to him as “the gentleman sitting to the right of Mr. [Yohanan] Bader.”
Mr. Biden and Begin once clashed, in a private June 1982 session with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Biden, 39, lectured the 68-year-old Begin over Israeli settlements, jabbing his finger at the prime minister and banging his fist on the desk. Mr. Biden warned that eroding support for Israel threatened U.S. aid. Israel was at war in Lebanon and far more dependent on American assistance than it is today.
Begin wouldn’t be cowed. “Don’t threaten us with cutting off aid to give up our principles,” he shouted back, according to Time magazine. Former Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon later recalled that Begin went further: “I’m not a Jew with trembling knees,” he reminded Mr. Biden.
In the lore that has since developed, Begin’s response supposedly continued: “I am a proud Jew with 3,700 years of civilized history. Nobody came to our aid when we were dying in the gas chambers and ovens. Nobody came to our aid when we were striving to create our country. We paid for it. We fought for it. We died for it. We will stand by our principles. We will defend them. And, when necessary, we will die for them again, with or without your aid.”
We don’t know exactly what Begin said in the closed session. But the meeting was fiery. “I’ve never seen such an angry session with a foreign head of state.” said Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas. “It was a lively discussion,’’ Mr. Begin told the press afterward. “If you want to use other adjectives . . .” He paused, then reconsidered: “Lively is enough.’’
The encounter came early in Mr. Biden’s career and late in Begin’s. Decades in the wilderness had matured the Israeli leader but also aged him. In 1979, during his first term in office, Begin made difficult sacrifices for a peace with Egypt that continues today. The Begin who responded to Mr. Biden in 1982, however, was no longer at his best. The next year, in poor health and crushed by the death of his wife, Aliza, he resigned. He died in 1992 at 78.
Mr. Biden, who turns 78 on Friday, has waited longer than Begin did. We don’t know if the maturity and wisdom he has gained over the years will outweigh the loss of ability that comes with advanced age. America and the world are rooting for maturity and wisdom.

2020/11/19,Trade Truths Will Outlast Trump,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trade-truths-will-outlast-trump-11605828052,"Trade was central to Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign. He saw trade as a win-lose, zero-sum proposition, blaming trade deficits for deindustrializing the American heartland, calling the North American Free Trade Agreement “a disaster,” and condemning China for unfair trade practices. He thought getting tough on trade would give him the leverage to get better deals. 
President Trump called himself a “tariff man” and imposed 25% levies on imported steel and aluminum while launching a trade war against China. He pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, renegotiated Nafta, and threatened to leave the World Trade Organization. 
Mr. Trump’s defeat provides an opportune moment to reassess his trade policy. After four years, what have we learned? Many things, but especially that old economic truths still have value:
• Tariffs don’t reduce the trade deficit. If a country imports more than it exports, it would seem that tariffs would slash imports and help close the gap. But it doesn’t work that way. Economists have long pointed out that the trade deficit is driven by macroeconomic factors, particularly international capital flows. The strong pre-Covid economy, along with the administration’s expansionary fiscal policy, ensured that spending remained high and imports continued to pour in. The result: The merchandise trade deficit was $864 billion in 2019, more than $100 billion higher than in 2016.
Why didn’t tariffs help close the gap? Not unexpectedly, other countries retaliated by imposing stiff tariffs on our exports. And when the administration placed tariffs on China, imports were simply diverted to Vietnam and other foreign suppliers without reshoring production. 
• Tariffs are paid by consumers, destroy jobs and hurt the economy. Mr. Trump insisted that China would pay for the 15% to 25% duties that he imposed on $300 billion of its exports. In fact, the tariffs were passed on to American consumers, who paid more either directly for imported consumer goods or indirectly for imported intermediate inputs that increase production costs and ended up raising consumer prices. 
Take steel. Higher prices might have saved some jobs in the steel industry, but not many: The industry is capital-intensive and doesn’t employ the tens of thousands of workers of yesteryear. In the 1980s, it took 10 hours of work to produce a ton of steel; now it takes one hour. 
In fact, steel protection is a job-destroying policy. Economists at the Federal Reserve found that the steel and aluminum tariffs reduced overall employment in manufacturing by 75,000 workers. 
How could that be? Many more workers are employed in steel-using industries than in the steel industry itself. Higher steel prices penalized domestic producers of steel-intensive products, such as farm equipment and machinery, harming their competitive position in domestic and foreign markets (by reducing their exports and increasing other imports). Ford said higher steel prices cost it about $1 billion during a period from 2018-19.
More broadly, tariffs are a drag on the economy. In January, the Congressional Budget Office projected that higher tariffs would reduce real gross domestic product by roughly 0.5% and raise consumer prices by 0.5% this year, reducing average real household income by $1,277.
• Trade agreements are a key part of today’s globalized world. On the 2016 campaign trail, Mr. Trump excoriated Nafta as the worst trade agreement ever and threatened to pull out of it. Republicans from farm states—whose exports to Mexico have surged in the wake of the agreement—persuaded him to renegotiate it instead.
Mr. Trump boasted that he could get a better deal. But he never identified any provisions in the agreement that were unfair to the U.S., because there were none. He hated some of the outcomes that arose with Nafta—more imports from Mexico—while ignoring benefits to consumers as well as increased American exports to Mexico. 
The result? Nafta was rebranded as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which preserves zero tariffs on trade among all three countries while somewhat tightening rules in the auto sector. In the end, Nafta was simply too important to ditch.
• A China reset was overdue but requires a careful strategy. The Trump administration singled out China for its unfair trade practices and imposed tariffs on most Chinese imports. Here the administration was right: Beijing doesn’t follow the rules, or the rules don’t cover its model of state capitalism. But the administration’s heavy-handed approach was arguably counterproductive. 
Despite the president’s insistence that “trade wars are good, and easy to win,” they are costly and difficult to win. The tariffs came with a stiff price: Trump tariffs were met by immediate retaliation against farm exports, which has caused the administration to spend tens of billions of dollars to bail out ailing farmers. 
As for its vaunted Phase 1 trade agreement, China’s purchases are way behind its commitments, and U.S. exports remain depressed. An agreement on structural barriers in China remains to be negotiated, if it ever will be. The administration’s tough approach has caused Beijing to double down on its state-led model and put reformers on the defensive.
Washington needs an effective strategy to deal with China, and one that includes American allies is most likely to succeed. When Mr. Trump pulled out of the TPP without thought or study, we lost an opportunity to establish rules and cement relationships in the Asia-Pacific region.
All this points to a disappointing—but entirely predictable—set of outcomes that, unfortunately, have damaged the U.S. economy and alienated allies. The president sought to reduce the trade deficit, increase manufacturing employment, change China’s policies, and reach better deals, but fell short on all counts.

2020/11/19,Notable & Quotable: Gov. Andrew Cuomo,Notable & Quotable,https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-gov-andrew-cuomo-11605827866,"From New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Nov. 18 press conference:
Reporter: Governor, . . . some county sheriffs say they will not be enforcing the 10-person limit on gatherings in homes. . . .
Cuomo: On the sheriffs, I don’t believe as a law-enforcement officer you have a right to pick and choose what laws you will enforce. An EO [executive order] is a law that has been litigated, right? “Well, I don’t believe in that law, and therefore I won’t enforce it.”
That is frankly frightening to me as an individual, frightening to democracy. It’s arrogant, and it violates your constitutional duty. I didn’t say, “I swear to uphold the laws that I agree with.” I didn’t say that. “If I don’t agree with the law, then I’m not going to enforce that law.” No. It doesn’t matter what my opinion is. I’m a law-enforcement officer. I enforce the laws. I don’t get to pick and choose. 
“Well, I’m not going to enforce domestic-violence law, because I think that’s a family affair. They had a family fight and I don’t think it’s the state’s right to come in and say, ‘You shouldn’t treat your wife that way. You shouldn’t treat your husband that way.’ ” No. There’s a law, and you have to enforce the law, or don’t call yourself a law-enforcement officer. Say, “I enforce the laws that I think are good laws,” that’s what you get. But then I’m not a law-enforcement official and I’m not operating a law-enforcement agency. And that has consequences too. But that’s what I think. Last question.
Reporter: Governor, on that point, how do you expect them to enforce the 10-person limit? I mean, short of knocking door to door, I mean, how can you enforce that?
Cuomo: That’s a different question. Different question. Bona fide question. . . . I mean, nobody’s saying knock on doors, count heads, right? But you come across a gathering for one reason or another and there’s 20 people there, you say, “This can’t happen.” . . .
And this is really hard to stop because you’re right, it’s very hard to restrict, it’s very hard to regulate, and it’s very hard to police. So yeah, is it hard to police? Yes. But if you see it, stop it. That’s really the point of the law. If you see it, stop it. Don’t invade privacy, don’t do any of that. But if you see it, stop it. Which is different, John, than saying, “I just refuse to enforce that law because I don’t agree with it.” . . .
And this living-room spread is the new problem. And it will go up after Thanksgiving. And you will see orange zones and increased positivity after Thanksgiving. I’ll wager you on it today. And you’re going to see more dramatic action. And then it’s going to get worse, because what comes next? Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa. And that’s going to be the problem.

2020/11/19,"He Was Right About Schools, Too",Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/he-was-right-about-schools-too-11605820465,"Post-election, American media outlets seem to be relaxing the unwritten rule that positive comments about President Donald Trump’s policies must be buried beneath several paragraphs of personal condemnations. Yesterday this column noted the underreported accuracy of the President’s vaccine predictions. Today there is a growing if grudging acceptance that his critics have done enormous damage to poor children by rejecting his calls to keep schools open. 
Nicholas Kristof writes in the New York Times:
In fairness to Mr. Kristof, he has previously warned about the problems with distance learning and even now he is still diligent about sniping at the president. But these days a reader can more easily grasp the point. Writes Mr. Kristof:
And the campaign of devastation is not over. This seems to be a case where Democrats are refusing to listen to the scientists in favor of the teachers unions who lead the shutdown chorus. Michael Gartland of the New York Daily News reports on the city’s latest misguided mandate:
Mr. Gartland writes that the city closes schools when the daily percentage of New Yorkers testing positive for COVID reaches an average of 3% over a week and notes:
What is true in New York and around the world is that the costs inflicted on children outweigh the suspect benefits of school closures. On Wednesday the Scottish government summarized the evidence from schools in Scotland:
This is consistent with various other studies showing huge costs to children for uncertain benefits. Unfortunately, many heavily credentialed scientists keep letting kids down when it comes to policy recommendations. Government health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci have at times endorsed school closures even while admitting they had not conducted a thorough analysis of costs and benefits.
Let’s hope our next president will speak as forcefully on behalf of America’s children as our current one does.

2020/11/20,Georgia Certifies: Donald Trump Lost,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/georgia-certifies-donald-trump-lost-11605915757,"The recount in Georgia is finished, after workers examined five million ballots by hand, but President Trump still lags Joe Biden by 12,000 votes. Many of the figures barely budged: In 73% of Georgia’s 159 counties, the margin of the hand count varied from the original by 10 voters or fewer. In a quarter of counties, the two numbers exactly matched.
Across a few places, the audit turned up several thousand votes that had been overlooked. Fayette County neglected to upload a memory card, which left out 2,800 ballots. Floyd County found 2,600 ballots that hadn’t been re-scanned after a machine was replaced. The additions slightly narrowed Mr. Biden’s lead from a little above 14,000 last week.
America’s distributed elections are a source of resilience, since no central authority controls vote counting. The downside is the messiness of delegating the job, in Georgia’s case, to 159 local officials. But the errors don’t fit any conspiracy theory. Floyd County went 70% for Mr. Trump. Does anyone think a deeply red area intentionally forgot Republican votes? Floyd’s top voting official has now been fired, so at least shoddy elections have consequences.
The Trump legal team is dismissing the Georgia recount, but notice its retreat. “This so-called hand recount went exactly as we expected,” lawyer Jenna Ellis said, “because Georgia simply recounted all of the illegal ballots that had been included in the total.” Hang on: At a press conference hours earlier, attorney Sidney Powell alleged, without showing evidence, that Dominion voting machines “run an algorithm, that probably ran all over the country, to take a certain percentage of votes from President Trump and flip them to President Biden.”
What happened to that claim? A hand recount is a perfect way to test it, if you remember how Georgia’s voting machines work: Residents make their choices on a touch-screen. The system then prints a paper ballot, with a text summary showing the candidates selected, which provides the voter a chance to confirm.
If software flipped Georgia’s electronic totals, there would be some big, unexplained discrepancy between those data and the paper ballots. The hand recount found nothing of the sort. Georgia also asked Pro V&V, a testing laboratory certified by the federal Election Assistance Commission, to audit a random sample of Dominion machines. No tampering was found.
Another Trump line is that Georgia’s recount didn’t reverify the signatures on absentee votes. But the secret ballot is a hang-up: Once ballots are removed from the envelopes, there’s no way to match them up again. That’s why signature verification comes first. For the record, Georgia says that 0.15% of ballots, or 2,011 votes, were rejected for signature problems this year, compared with 0.16% in 2018.
To back up his claims, Rudy Giuliani on Thursday waved affidavits, specifically citing one from a Michigan city worker named Jessy Jacob. But here’s what state Judge Timothy Kenny wrote on Nov. 13: “Ms. Jacob’s information is generalized. It asserts behavior with no date, location, frequency, or names of employees.”
Some of the allegations are misunderstandings. Ms. Jacob’s claim that workers at Detroit’s TCF Center didn’t check signatures is baseless, the ruling said, since “the task had already been performed by other Detroit city clerks at a previous location.” Judge Kenny was first appointed by a Republican Governor.
Want to hear from a Trump judicial appointee? A federal lawsuit by the attorney L. Lin Wood asked to halt the certification of Georgia’s election, with affidavits alleging that some ballots looked funny or broke for Mr. Biden by a suspiciously high margin. Judge Steven Grimberg denied the request. “The actual harm alleged by Wood,” he wrote Friday, “concerns merely a ‘garden variety’ election dispute.”
At Mr. Giuliani’s news conference, the accusations included a theory that software on Dominion equipment was designed by Venezuela to rig elections. The conspiracy apparently goes deep. “We have no idea,” Ms. Powell said, “how many Republican or Democratic candidates in any state across the country paid to have the system rigged to work for them.”
If Mr. Trump had solid evidence of massive wrongdoing, it should be taken to court by a serious practicing attorney. Mr. Giuliani’s role as lead lawyer suggests this is political theater. To what end? Perhaps Mr. Trump wants to test if Republican state legislatures in Michigan, Georgia or Pennsylvania might directly name Trump electors, overruling the state’s vote for Mr. Biden. That’s a dark road to go down.
If it succeeded in denying Mr. Biden 270 electoral votes, the result would be a backlash that would be a calamity for the GOP. It would draw legal challenges and might head to the Supreme Court. For the gambit to work, more than one state would have to be involved. But even if a single state took this course, it would be a terrible precedent that Republicans would live to regret.
All of this shows that Mr. Trump’s path to overturning the state vote counts is vanishing fast. If his lawyers can’t bring to court more evidence than they have presented in public, they will lose. Recounts and audits continue in Wisconsin and Michigan, but the state deadlines for certifying results are coming fast, and the electors must be chosen by Dec. 8.
Republicans have given Mr. Trump ample leeway to prove his case for ballot fraud, and we’ve approached his claims with an open mind. But if there’s no evidence beyond general innuendo, the President’s charges of a stolen election will undermine public faith in the electoral system. That won’t serve the country, his party, or his supporters, who will sour on politics and in the process cede elections to the left. None of this will serve Mr. Trump, his legacy, or whatever hope he has to run again in 2024.

2020/11/20,Trump’s Gift to Joe Biden,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-gift-to-joe-biden-11605915662,"Congratulations to drug companies for their tremendous work developing Covid-19 vaccines and therapies in record time. Their reward from the Trump Administration is a new regulation imposing drug price controls, which will make it easier for Joe Biden to go further next year. 
The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday finalized a “most-favored nation” rule requiring drug makers to give Medicare the lowest price they charge comparable developed countries. This means the feds will refuse to pay more for medicines than government-run health systems in Europe. Didn’t Mr. Trump campaign against socialism? 
While Medicare pays more for medicines than most countries, Americans also get earlier access to more life-saving treatments. According to the Galen Institute, 96% of new cancer therapies are available in the U.S. compared to 73% in Germany, 66% in France and 54% in Japan. Mr. Trump’s penny-pinching will result in fewer breakthrough treatments. 
Most drugs fail in clinical trials, including some 97% of oncology treatments. The rare successes finance research and development into new medicines. It doesn’t take a brain surgeon to understand that drug makers will spend less on new medicines if government cuts their return on investment.
HHS is rushing out the rule without seeking public comment under its authority to test new payment models to reduce federal spending and improve patient care. Such tests typically are voluntary and involve a small patient or hospital population. The most-favored nation rule will be imposed by fiat nationwide. 
A President Biden will no doubt run with Mr. Trump’s legally dubious precedent. Mr. Biden has proposed requiring drug makers to charge even private insurers the same price as Medicare, and his regulators could use Mr. Trump’s same flawed administrative edict to impose it.
Politico reported this week that Mr. Trump pushed HHS to jam through the most-favored nation rule because he is angry that Pfizer didn’t publicly disclose that its Covid-19 vaccine was 95% effective until after the election. “Pfizer and others even decided to not assess the results of their vaccine, in other words, not come out with a vaccine, until just after the election. That’s because of what I did with favored nations and these other elements,” President Trump said Friday, more or less confirming the Politico story. But perhaps Pfizer’s delay was because the data wasn’t available. 
The new rule is likely to be blocked in court, but it will tarnish the Administration’s record of accelerating drug approvals, Covid vaccines and therapies. Industry experts expect the next Congress to pass some form of drug price legislation. Maybe it’s good the pandemic hit before politicians could do more damage to pharmaceutical innovation.

2020/11/20,Colorado Targets Oil and Gas,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/colorado-targets-oil-and-gas-11605915600,"Colorado regulators are preparing to approve sweeping new restrictions on oil and gas companies on Monday. Meanwhile, the companies received an unintended glimpse this week of how their regulators hold them in contempt.
For years state law required the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to strike a balance between energy development and protecting the environment and the public. But Democrats tipped the scales against oil and gas last year with Senate Bill 181.
The new legislation installed professional regulators on the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission while reducing the number of energy representatives. Under the new statute, the commission’s mission is no longer to “foster” energy development but to “regulate” it to protect the environment, wildlife and public health, safety and welfare. 
On Monday the regulators are expected to finalize new restrictions as part of a broader overhaul of Colorado’s rules on energy development. Most significant is a proposal to restrict new energy development within 2,000 feet of schools, homes and other buildings, and another that would impose setbacks near waterways and wildlife. This could put millions of acres of Colorado land off limits for fracking. The commission says oil and gas companies could seek waivers in some circumstances, but there’s no guarantee they’d be granted. Under the new regulatory regime, that would be left to regulators’ discretion. 
Colorado voters rejected a similar scheme in 2018 when they voted down Prop. 112, which would have imposed a 2,500-foot setback on energy development. That ballot measure would have put 85% of all non-federal land off limits, and it would also have cost up to $1.1 billion in lost annual tax revenue by 2030, according to an analysis from the Common Sense Policy Roundtable, reviewed by faculty from the Colorado School of Mines. Coloradans weren’t willing to bear these costs.
Never mind. The commission is now preparing to vote on another version of the same idea, and it hasn’t bothered to analyze the potential harm to jobs or the Colorado economy. That’s no small shortcoming in a state that ranked seventh in the U.S. for energy production in 2018. Some 100,000 residents depend on the industry for their livelihoods.
The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission added insult to injury with a revealing internet blunder that unfolded Sunday. Its staffers were tinkering with a new online filing system and accidentally sent oil and gas developers a test email, which included “disparaging fake company names,” the Denver Post reported. The snark included such subtle epithets as “Snake Oil Inc,” “Bad Oil and Gas,” and “The Lorax.” 
Commission spokeswoman Megan Castle apologized for the insults and said it “doesn’t demonstrate who we are as individuals or an organization.” But it sure does demonstrate what regulatory staffers think about the industry that employs so many of their fellow citizens.

2020/11/20,Steven Mnuchin’s Finest Hour,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/steve-mnuchins-finest-hour-11605908477,"The late, great Milton Friedman used to say that nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program. That’s one of many reasons taxpayers should thank Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for moving to end most of the Federal Reserve’s special pandemic lending facilities on Dec. 31 as Congress intended.
This isn’t popular at the Fed, which likes its growing ability to allocate credit and please politicians with loans to their allies. It also won’t go down well on most of Wall Street, which loves the Fed backstops. And Democrats are unhappy because they want a long-term call on the Fed for their own political ends. 
But Mr. Mnuchin has acted in the best interests of the economy and the federal fisc, and the facts of the financial markets and politics explain why. Specifically, Mr. Mnuchin asked Mr. Powell in a letter Thursday to end the facilities that the Fed stood up with money under the March Cares Act. This includes the state and municipal lending program, primary and secondary corporate credit facilities, the Main Street facility for businesses, and the program for asset-backed securities.
All of these programs were created in an emergency at the onset of the pandemic when the financial markets were in danger of melting down. The Fed also stood up facilities, without Cares Act money, for commercial paper, money-market funds, and primary dealer credit. 
The programs worked. Even as the pandemic and government shutdowns have waxed and waned, financial markets have healed. Lending spreads have fallen, and liquidity is ample in nearly all markets.
The facilities worked even without the Fed doing much lending. Their existence alone helped restore confidence. Treasury provided some $195 billion in Cares Act cash to backstop the facilities. But the Fed has made only $25 billion in loans or funding for other assets. Small and large businesses have ample access to credit, and so do cities and states.
Democrats are squawking about the Municipal Liquidity Facility going away, but so far it has made only two loans: one to the sorry state of Illinois for $1.2 billion and one to New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority for $450 million. New Jersey considered the Fed facility, but this week it floated $3.7 billion in bonds paying 1.95% in the private markets and the offer was oversubscribed. If even a deadbeat like Trenton can tap the private markets, there’s no need for the Fed to do the lending.
Mr. Mnuchin has also asked the Fed to return $455 billion in unused Cares Act funding to the Treasury. That money will sit in the general fund and Congress can reappropriate it for other uses. It could pay for a new Covid relief bill if Speaker Nancy Pelosi ever agrees to compromise. Or it could be used to reduce the deficit (we can dream).
None of this means the Fed is out of ammo. Mr. Mnuchin has extended for 90 days four Fed facilities that were set up with pre-Cares Act money in Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). That includes the commercial paper and money-market programs. The ESF also retains some $80 billion, and $50 billion of that could quickly be used to leverage as much as $500 billion in lending if need be. The Fed will also retain $25 billion in its facilities that it could use to leverage another $250 billion.
The Fed issued a statement on Thursday griping about Mr. Mnuchin’s decision, which proves the secretary’s point. Chairman Powell is behaving like a politician these days, opining on fiscal policy that is not part of his mandate. But it would be an abuse of his authority and a rejection of Congressional intent if he refuses to return the $455 billion to Treasury. 
He’d essentially be saying that any money handed to the Fed in an emergency is the Fed’s to use for whatever purpose and for as long as the central bank wants. This would be an unprecedented intrusion into fiscal policy. And it would make Congress understandably reluctant to hand more money to the Fed in the future. Senators Mike Crapo and Pat Toomey, who negotiated the Cares Act language in detail, issued statements Thursday supporting Congress’s intent to terminate the emergency programs on Dec. 31. Late Friday Mr. Powell replied in a letter to Mr. Mnuchin that the Fed will work with the Treasury to return the money.
The termination is also important to limit the demands by politicians to use the Fed for policies they can’t get through Congress. Four Senators, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, wrote Messrs. Powell and Mnuchin this month urging that the Fed programs be expanded. Democrats want the Fed to bail out states, invest in public works, add climate mandates and promote racial justice. The U.S. economy doesn’t need more politicized credit.
Political actors rarely cede power or money they’ve received in emergencies, and thus do temporary programs become permanent. Mr. Mnuchin has done a public service in breaking that pattern, and Mr. Powell will as well if he follows that good example.

2020/11/20,Notable & Quotable: Remus on Alito,Notable & Quotable,https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-remus-on-alito-11605909961,"From a June 27, 2013, letter to the editor of the Washington Post by William Ranney Levi and Dana Remus. On Tuesday Joe Biden announced Ms. Remus will be his White House counsel:
Having clerked for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, we were more than a little surprised by Dana Milbank’s June 25 Washington Sketch, “Alito is on a roll. An eye roll.” . . . 
Mr. Milbank criticized Justice Alito for allegedly making faces during Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s reading of her dissent, contending that this is typical behavior when his female colleagues read their opinions. When Justice Sonia Sotomayor joked while announcing a decision in a “little-watched case about water rights,” for instance, Mr. Milbank said that Justice Alito “rolled his eyes and shook his head.” Mr. Milbank did not mention that Justice Alito had in fact joined Justice Sotomayor’s opinion. . . . The worst aspect of this snide piece, however, was the suggestion that Justice Alito has some deep and abiding disrespect for women. Mr. Milbank said that Justice Alito “mocked” Justice Ginsburg, “the second woman to serve on the high court,” and “demonstrated his disdain” for Justices Elena Kagan and Sotomayor. This suggestion is offensive and couldn’t be further from the truth, as his many female clerks can attest.
Those of us who have been fortunate to work closely with Justice Alito know that he is a good man who serves every day with humility, dedication and incredible intelligence and insight.
Mr. Milbank is a humorist and satirist. He can make mountains out of molehills if he wants to. But he should take a page out of Justice Alito’s book and pay more attention to getting it right.

2020/11/20,Media Banality Is a Covid Comorbidity,Business World,https://www.wsj.com/articles/media-banality-is-a-covid-comorbidity-11605909942,"National Public Radio host: “We have said the words grim milestone so many times over the past eight months on this program, and yet here we are once more. The number this time—250,000. . . . Each digit in that number, a life now gone, their loved ones now grieving. The collective loss is hard to measure.”
NPR reporter: “You know, Rachel, each of these terrible new milestones is so big they can start to feel incomprehensible. So I’ve been struggling to find a way to put such a terrible tragedy into some kind of context. It’s hard. But 250,000 deaths is about five times the number of U.S. troops killed in combat in Vietnam. It’s nearly five times the number of Americans who died in combat in World War I.”

These words (and I’ve spared you the full version) were spoken with the dramatic intonation that NPR apparently now requires of its on-air performers, indicating not informational content but somebody’s idea of the appropriate emotional response to be extorted from listeners. And yet the question that started this discussion could have been answered in another way more befitting a news organization: 250,000 is 9% more than the estimated U.S. death toll from the 1957 flu, adjusted for population; it’s 34% larger than the 1968 flu’s death toll; it’s about one-fifth the 1918 pandemic’s.
At least our reporter didn’t tell us that laying the victims end to end would reach from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.
Covid-19 has nothing to do with the Vietnam War. It is nothing like World War I. It’s not even like heart disease, which kills an estimated 655,000 Americans a year and will likely continue doing so for the foreseeable future.
Covid-19 is a completely different phenomenon of its own. Why not say so?
It begins with natural selection. Unknown millions of virus types exist in the world; the number of individual viruses is believed to be 10 times the number of biological cells. A liter of seawater contains about 10 billion viruses. Viruses are a major driver, perhaps the key driver, of genetic ferment in the biosphere. Some 20% to 40% of all bacterial cells in the ocean die from viral infection each day.
We wouldn’t be here without this giant, complicated mixmaster. It’s a tragedy for humanity when a new deadly virus comes into the world, leaving a noticeable imprint on the mortality tables, accounting for 9% of all U.S. deaths this year. Unlike car accidents and opioid overdoses, Covid deaths are likely to be much reduced next year. Human immune systems will adapt. Vaccines will be deployed. We get invaluable help, which our ancestors never received, from science to endure this new threat from nature as we continue the activities necessary for human survival and advancement.
A rule of thumb for journalists: When you find yourself trying to peddle emotion, stop. When you catch yourself selecting facts and claims and metaphors for their sentimental wallop rather than intellectual merit, rethink. The public needs information and context, not help milking its tear ducts.
In reality Covid deaths going from 249,999 to 250,000 is a largely meaningless milestone and the hoariest kind of fake news. When deaths hit 200,000, listeners could already figure out how many more would make 250,000. Many also knew, unmentioned in NPR’s sermon which likened the daily death toll to several jumbo jet crashes, that most of these deaths are from Covid plus other conditions that afflict the old and chronically ill. Still, the 250,000 milestone was the most reported factoid everywhere on Thursday and Friday, so another hint for journalists: If you find yourself straining for ways to sensationalize a claim that listeners have already heard 50 times, maybe just drop it and move on.
In our interesting times, sadly, what is most noticeable is the shrill, hoarse wind of banality that blows from our multibillion-dollar media industry. A contrast last week was a concise insight from a hospital executive buried in a long New Yorker article: “The only way you can eradicate the virus with today’s tools is if you’re a totalitarian government or on an island.”
And I have my doubts about totalitarian governments. In Western Europe, where neither condition applies, deaths last week were running 75% higher than in the U.S. on a population-adjusted basis. New infections were also registering a sharp downturn as citizens responded to this feedback. As in the past, we’re likely to find individual choices to curb transmission preceded the partial lockdown measures now being implemented. Free societies do not have the advantage in every instance, but their strength is free flow of information and individual responsibility even when that information flows with less value-added from the media than it should.

2020/11/20,Covid Out of Context,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-out-of-context-11605909034,"Perhaps the greatest failing of the American media this year has been a widespread neglect to put Covid risks in the context of other risks to human health—including risks created by the myopic focus on Covid. 
Thank goodness the medical research enterprise seems on its way to addressing the source of so much fear. The Journal’s Jared Hopkins reports:
Unfortunately most media coverage is not improving at the same rate, and may even encourage politicians to repeat the panic that inspired the spring shutdowns. 
The U.S. death toll is sad enough without efforts to make it appear even sadder. “How much is 250,000 deaths? Enough to empty wide swaths of the country,” is the bizarre headline on a Washington Post report. 
Authors Lauren Tierney and Tim Meko might have used the opportunity to place the Covid numbers in context and point out that 10 times as many Americans will likely die of other causes this year.
They might have noted that the total U.S. population is more than 330 million people. Instead, the Post reporters urge readers to imagine that all of the Covid deaths are concentrated in one of the rural counties of the American northwest:
Sure, and if every one of this year’s U.S. cancer deaths occurred in Wyoming, there would be no one left in the Cowboy State. And if all of America’s heart disease deaths struck only in Memphis, Poplar Avenue would be empty. 
Readers are of course free to decide how to value a newspaper which encourages them to view events out of context.
*** 
Coincidentally a number of the counties suggested by the Post in its thought experiment happen to be in South Dakota, which is back in the news for a related reason. Media folk periodically enjoy portraying the state as a sort of Covid armageddon because its governor Kristi Noem has wisely favored personal responsibility over government mandates to fight the virus. Reports of rising cases often neglect the fact that even on a per capita basis, South Dakota has suffered less than half the Covid death toll this year of New Jersey or New York. 
In Sioux Falls, it seems the governor isn’t the only one resisting a panic. Joe Sneve reports in the Argus Leader:
This message is particularly helpful because across the country, one lessons of this year’s shutdowns is that a panicked response can itself create unrelated crises. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association reports:
Sometimes even life-saving vaccines aren’t enough if adults in positions of power don’t act responsibly.

2020/11/20,The Duo That Defeated the ‘Diversity Industry’,The Weekend Interview,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-duo-that-defeated-the-diversity-industry-11605904415,"Ward Connerly, 81, is a black Louisiana native who’s spent the past quarter-century campaigning against racial preferences. Wenyuan Wu, 33, is a Chinese immigrant who has recently become an activist opposed to anti-Asian discrimination in higher education. They joined forces this June. 
He’s the grizzled mentor who says he got out of his “rocking chair” to defend “the American creed.” She, his protegee, is outspoken about freedom in the classic American way, yet deferential to the older man in a manner that’s unmistakably Asian. She refers to him as “Mr. Connerly” throughout the interview, which is done on Zoom—Ms. Wu speaking from rural Georgia, where she lives because “the cost of living is low”; Mr. Connerly from an office near California’s capital, Sacramento.
The pair led the team that vanquished California’s progressive elite on Nov. 3, when Proposition 16—a ballot referendum that would have reinstated racial preferences by state and local government agencies, including universities—was defeated, 57% to 43%, according to the latest count. Mr. Connerly is president and Ms. Wu executive director of Californians for Equal Rights, known widely as No on 16, the principal committee organized in opposition to the ballot measure. “Mr. Connerly is captain of the team,” she says impishly. “I’m the enforcer.” 
The result should be “chastening for the left and the race activists,” Mr. Connerly says. Joe Biden carried California nearly 2 to 1 over President Trump. That means at least 3.5 million Biden voters cast ballots against the racial-preference amendment, which Democratic lawmakers put on the ballot and Mr. Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, endorsed. 
It’s not the first time something like this has happened. Proposition 209, the constitutional initiative that banned preferences in the first place, won California voters’ approval in 1996, even as Bill Clinton was carrying California on his way to re-election. Although the state has shifted considerably to the left since then—Mr. Biden’s vote share exceeded Mr. Clinton’s by more than 12 points—the rejection of racial preferences appears to have been even more resounding this time. Proposition 209, styled the California Civil Rights Initiative, had less than 55% support. 
Mr. Connerly led the 1996 ballot effort after persuading his fellow University of California regents to ban preferences in UC admissions earlier that year. The state was the first to adopt a ban on racial preferences. Eight more have done so since, five by ballot measure (Washington, Michigan, Nebraska, Arizona and Oklahoma), two by legislation (New Hampshire and Idaho), and one by executive order of the governor (Florida). Mr. Connerly says proudly that “37.7% of people in our country live in a state that is free of preferences.” 
All this despite the outsize clout of preference proponents. No on 16 had to overcome a vast funding disparity. Whereas the referendum’s backers had a war chest of $27 million, “we raised a little over $1.7 million,” Ms. Wu says, “and nearly all of our funds came from 7,000 Chinese-American donors of modest means.” Asians are harder hit than whites by racial preferences in higher education; Ms. Wu estimates their admissions to UC schools would have fallen as much as 50% if Proposition 16 passed. When an NBC reporter raised this point with a Democratic state senator, he shrugged it off: “Black and Hispanic people have even greater concerns.”
The Yes campaign received $6.5 million from a single donor— Quinn Delaney, chairman of the Oakland-based Akonadi Foundation, which says it aims to “eliminate structural racism.” The largest contribution received by No on 16 was less than 1% as large—$50,000 from Students for Fair Admissions, a nonprofit group that has sued Harvard, alleging that it discriminates against Asians. 
“ Patricia Quillin, wife of the Netflix CEO, gave $1 million,” Ms. Wu adds, then goes on to list other givers of “big sums”: the California Teachers Association, Blue Shield, the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Other donors include Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, as well as owners of the San Francisco 49ers, the San Francisco Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers. By contrast, Ms. Wu says, the lone $50,000 donation accounted for “only 2.9% of our funds.”
If No on 16 was a grassroots movement, the Yes campaign was a redwood grove. Ms Wu calls opponents the “diversity industry” and “Big Diversity”—“like Big Pharma, Big Tobacco!” The Yes on 16 website boasts nearly 900 endorsements from politicians, nonprofits, newspapers and other corporations. When I ask Mr. Connerly how his side managed to prevail, there’s no false modesty in his answer: “First of all, you could say that we just ran a masterful campaign. That would be one explanation.” 
Another would be that in 1996 preferences had long been the rule, so that “we had to convince the people of the state that equality was the right way to go, and that it would not produce adverse consequences.” And today “there’s no systemic racism in the state of California,” Mr. Connerly says. “There were still remnants of that back in 1996.” By now, “it may very well be that the question of equality—of equal citizenship—is accorded the same kind of stature in our culture as that of liberty,” an ideal Americans recognize as “self-evident.”
“Equal citizenship is not negotiable any more,” Mr. Connerly says. “You get the same rights, same responsibilities. You own just as much cultural stock in the country as anyone else.” Black people “have not always been accorded equal citizenship, I can tell you, because I know a little bit about that,” having been born in the South in 1939. But America has overcorrected for past wrongs. “Black people have been accorded a certain stature in American life” because of their history, Mr. Connerly says. “In the race sweepstakes right now, being black means that you get preferred stock.” Unless you’re a “race advocate,” he adds, “that is not a good thing.” 
President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Executive Order 11246 of 1965 required government contractors to “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin.” That, Mr. Connerly says, “began an era of racial bean-counting that has brought us to where we are today, with ‘diversity’ and ‘affirmative action’ on steroids, being used not really for black people, but to remake America.” Proposition 16, he says, was intended to “transform California and usher in the use of race unlike anything we’ve ever seen in our country.” 
Yet the racial debate isn’t black and white any longer. Mr. Connerly says Asian-Americans have “had the temerity to rise up and say, ‘Hey, what about us?’ ” Ms. Wu is an example. Regarding affirmative action, she asks: “What should we really affirm? Do we affirm rigid racial lines that are outdated, or do we affirm real-life disadvantages that cut across racial, ethnic and gender lines?”
Ms. Wu came to the U.S. in 2009 from Wuxi, population five million—“a small town by Chinese standards.” She earned a doctorate in international studies from the University of Miami and was “perplexed” when it dawned on her that Asians, “as a group, are being scapegoated in education to fulfill a narrative of very shallow diversity.” It shocked her to discover that America wasn’t living up to its ideals as a “land free for everyone.” 
She hears from parents in New York’s Chinatown who fear their children will be squeezed out of the city’s specialized public high schools because of their leftist mayor’s push for “diversity.” They tell her that they worry their kids will be unable to “redeem the American dream.” These are poor parents who don’t speak English and have told their children: “You work hard, you study hard, you’re going to get out this ethnic enclave. You’re going to get out of Chinatown.” 
When politicians and school administrators say there are “too many” Asians in elite classrooms, “I feel minimized,” Ms. Wu says. “I feel stigmatized that I was reduced to a racial box—that my hard work is being blamed for the lack of so-called proportionality in these institutions.” Mr. Connerly, listening, can’t contain himself. “I have a more visceral reaction,” he says. “I am repulsed by that kind of language, because I have lived it. That’s what’s wrong with prejudice. You don’t see people as individuals.” 
Mr. Connerly describes the Asian-American fight for educational equality as “probably the truest civil-rights movement of our time.” The civil-rights movement in the 1960s, he says, “was about civil rights, yes. But it became about advancing the condition of black people.” That’s why “you have people who have accused me of not really being a civil-rights guy—because civil rights in their mind is Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. But those guys are race advocates.” Mr. Connerly offers a test for whether people are “really pro-civil rights”: “It’s when they will defend the right of a white person—a white male—to be treated equal to everyone else.” 
The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the use of racial preferences in college admissions to achieve “diversity” in a series of rulings: University of California v. Bakke (1978), Grutter v. Bollinger (2003) and Fisher v. University of Texas (2016). On Nov. 12, the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Harvard’s favor in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, rejecting the claim of anti-Asian discrimination.
Mr. Connerly is confident the U.S. Supreme Court, with a newly minted 6-3 Republican-appointed majority, will reverse that decision and overturn its precedents. “With Prop. 16 having been rejected as decisively as it was—strike ‘decisively,’ make that overwhelmingly—and with the court having been reconfigured by President Trump, we might get the decision that we need sooner than one would have thought.” 
Stressing that he’s “only reading the tea-leaves,” Mr. Connerly says the Supreme Court could “go back to the Bakke case and say the Constitution is colorblind. They would look at the 14th Amendment. They would also say: We’re not legislators, and the Congress has already ruled in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that there should not be discrimination on the basis of race. Why have we been ignoring this command for all these years?”
In a final flight of imagination, Mr. Connerly adds, “They’ll ask Justice [Clarence] Thomas to write the majority decision here, to end racial preferences. And Justice Thomas will write, ‘Free at last. Free at last.’ ” 
Mr. Varadarajan is a Journal contributor and a fellow at New York University Law School’s Classical Liberal Institute. 
Correction			Contributions under $50,000 accounted for all but 2.9% of the No on 16 campaign’s funding. An earlier version misstated the threshold.

2020/11/20,"Payday Lenders, Gun Salesmen—and Taking Politics Out of Banking",Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/payday-lenders-gun-salesmenand-taking-politics-out-of-banking-11605904346,"Everyone deserves fair access to banking services. Over the past decade there have been too many allegations of banks cutting off vital services, credit and capital that legal businesses rely on to create jobs, meet community needs and support the economy.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, where we serve as acting comptroller and chief economist, respectively, on Friday proposed a rule to prevent banks from discriminating against legal businesses and individuals. The rule would require bankers to do what they do best: assess risk and underwrite credit decisions.
The OCC has issued guidance regarding fair access and has long held that banks should avoid terminating entire categories of customer accounts without assessing individual risks and the bank’s ability to manage them. The proposed rule would codify that guidance and uphold the principle of nondiscrimination so everyone can access the nation’s banking system.
Our office has heard concerns from Alaska’s congressional delegation that many banks were refusing to provide credit for oil and gas production, ostensibly reflecting a political opposition to drilling rather than the creditworthiness of individual customers.
This is not the first time that politically driven discrimination against particular industries has threatened fairness in banking. Under the Obama administration, Operation Choke Point, in which the OCC did not take part, involved regulators discouraging banks from serving legal and constitutionally protected businesses such as payday lenders and gun and ammunition sellers. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions abolished the program in 2017. 
But now the country’s largest banks may be imposing their own voluntary Operation Choke Point. Evidence from public sources, as well as additional facts we learned from the banks we oversee, reveals practices that amount to redlining whole parts of the economy that banks find politically unpalatable, including independent ATM operators, gun manufacturers, coal producers, private correctional facilities, and energy companies. Also under threat of interest-group pressure campaigns are gasoline-powered car manufacturing, large farms and ranches. Many of the targeted industries are those unpopular on the political left. But we’ve also heard allegations of banks being pressured to cut off programs and business disfavored on the right, such as Planned Parenthood. 
Banks are special institutions, particularly national banks and federal thrifts, which are chartered to operate nationwide under a system of federal supervision that enhances customer confidence in their safety and soundness. Banks also have the federal government standing behind their insured deposits and have access to the Federal Reserve System. 
Because of this special status, it makes sense that the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 added to the OCC’s traditional mission of safety and soundness the obligation to ensure fair access to financial services—an obligation that is distinct from the equally important requirement of fair treatment for all customers. The proposed rule defines fair access and explains how the agency proposes to regulate banks covered by the rule. 
The proposal is simple. Banks may not exclude entire parts of the economy for reasons unrelated to objective, quantifiable risks specific to an individual customer. Banks retain the right to choose what businesses they take on—a bank does not have to engage in asset-based lending, for instance. But it cannot deny a service it provides except on the basis of an objective analysis of the riskiness of the client. Banks are not free to refuse credit simply because they don’t agree with a customer’s business. 
Banks don’t set national policy. They don’t choose what goods and services are available to consumers. Nor do they determine which industries are legal. It is the job of democratically elected government to make those decisions. It is a bank’s job to assess and manage risks of serving and financing their customers, while providing access for all legal businesses and individuals. 
The compliance costs are expected to be minimal. Covered banks simply need to make clear within their organizations that redlining lawful businesses is unacceptable. One could argue that lenders benefit from the rule because it insulates them from political pressure by special interests. 
Fair access is not only a legal requirement of Dodd-Frank; it is a principle that reflects two centuries of American commitment to ensure that chartered banks don’t abuse their public trust by granting politically motivated special access to credit and capital. The debates on this topic go back to the founding of the First and Second Banks of the United States, particularly President Andrew Jackson’s 1832 veto of the Second Bank’s rechartering over concerns about monopoly power by a chartered bank. 
That same commitment to equal access underlay President Lincoln’s 1863 establishment of the National Banking System, in which national bank charters are available to anyone who can satisfy a common set of rules and standards. The National Banking System and the OCC are still committed to ensuring equal access to the benefits of bank charters and bank credit for all.

2020/11/20,"Trump, the Republican Party and the Future",Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-the-republican-party-and-the-future-11605901903,"Regarding William A. Galston’s “Trump Remade His Party and the World” (op-ed, Nov. 14): President Trump’s impact on the party and the world could more accurately be described as “damaged.” The president leaves the Republican Party unrecognizable and its leadership trembling at the voting power of Mr. Trump’s misguided followers. While it was once home to Abraham Lincoln’s determination to preserve and reunify our nation, and Ronald Reagan’s unifying message of optimism for all Americans, the Republican Party under Donald Trump undermines the very foundations of our nation and the very democracy we all depend on by denying the election results, baselessly alleging fraud and leading his disillusioned and searching followers down a self-destructive path of deception and conspiracy theory.
It is an astounding condemnation of the Republican Party leadership that none of its members has risen to the task of protecting the nation from the damaging lies of an outgoing, unhinged president. When will the Republicans find the courage and message to bring the party back to its historical significance, to tell President Trump’s followers that the emperor has no clothes?
Let’s hope they find the courage to do that, just as Lincoln found the courage to lead the nation to reunification.

Most Americans will come to realize that after boldly twice electing African-American President Obama, he did virtually nothing to improve race relations or the lives of most African-Americans. Rather, we will come to accept that President Trump did more for black Americans with a soaring (pre-Covid) economy, very low unemployment rates, an increase in real household income and by improving rates of homeownership and providing assistance to opportunity zones and historically black colleges. This despite the media’s unsubstantiated accusations of racism, constant criticism and refusal to report his accomplishments. We will also come to realize that the most severe impact to the American body politic is that the same press went all in to excoriate President Trump and embrace the Democratic presidential candidate, even going as far as to ignore serious allegations of corruption by the latter. Much as with the 2007-09 recession, the devastating loss of the objective press has been underestimated and will hinder political discourse for decades.

Given President Trump’s status as a great deal maker, one can see that he has no deal on North Korea, no deal on China, no deal on Iran, no deal on the Paris Climate Accords, no deal on infrastructure, immigration, gun control and no deal on health care. His divisiveness and poor record of accomplishment surely will reduce his stature in the world.
Gerry Kirstein
Medford, Ore.
What Mr. Galston perceives as a surge of hope for a burgeoning global integration in the early 21st century is likely a perspective held primarily by the highly educated, professional, largely coastal elites. This enthusiasm for a global village wasn’t experienced by those in the middle and working classes, who for years experienced shrinking economic opportunity, job losses and an assault on their traditional values. This large swath of America found in Donald Trump a spokesman for the frustrations they long felt as the elites moved forward with policies antagonistic to their needs and interests.
President Trump’s popularity can be viewed not as a sign of cultural and political decadence but an attempt to democratically shift the priorities away from those formulated by cultural and political leaders long out of touch with many of their fellow citizens whom they claim to be shepherding into the future, though not a future of the non-elite’s making.

2020/11/20,Swiss Cheese Approach to Beating Epidemics,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-cheese-approach-to-beating-epidemics-11605901839,"Nicholas Christakis’s “The Swiss Cheese Model for Combating Covid-19” (Review, Nov. 14) is missing a slice of cheese that could make a big difference: better anticipating and then preventing, or containing, new epidemics. While we cannot do this with perfect success, we have more epidemiological, analytical, predictive and logistical tools at our disposal than ever before. Perhaps we can use new algorithms that identify suspicious pathogenic activity, along with quick-strike teams to collect and examine local sewage where novel pathogens are likely to show up early on, then aggressively containing and preventing the spread while working immediately on treatments, months or a year earlier than we did with Covid-19. Let’s at least admit we aren’t doing this because it may take years, or even decades, to pay off, and not because we don’t have the capabilities.

Great theory. Lumber engineering has a similar theory called “repetitive member allowance.” Individual boards have individual defects (defects are the basis of lumber grading), but when you conjoin multiple boards the defects are spread more nearly randomly. Result: The whole or the combination is stronger than the parts.

2020/11/20,Richard Nixon: An Example of Cross-Partisan Kindness,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/richard-nixon-an-example-of-cross-partisan-kindness-11605901747,"I was very moved by Luke A. Nichter’s “When Nixon Taped Joe Biden” (op-ed, Nov. 16) about President Nixon reaching out to console Senator-elect Joe Biden after the death his wife and daughter in a 1972 automobile accident, which also injured Mr. Biden’s two young sons. I was moved partly because my own wife was killed in a 1978 automobile accident which also injured my two young daughters, but I was also moved because Richard Nixon, a Republican president, reached out to a member of the opposite party to offer sympathy and support in a time of tragedy, displaying the sense of humanity that unites us all. 
This is a refreshing memory in our time of unending and unyielding political discord.

2020/11/20,Harvard and Favoring Some Ethnic Groups Over Others,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/harvard-and-favoring-some-ethnic-groups-over-others-11605901796,"Your editorial “Harvard vs. Asian-Americans” (Nov. 13) on racial preferences at Harvard states: “The U.S. is far more ethnically diverse than it once was, with many more groups qualifying as minorities.” Really? In the contrived racial category of “white” alone, there are over 100 ethnic groups, and it has been this way for a hundred years or so. For sure, most were looked down on as unworthy minorities for much of American history by the ruling Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
It’s intellectual fraud and borderline racist for Harvard and other universities to believe that some minorities bring better diversity to campus than other minorities—that, for instance, the descendants of upper-caste East Indians bring better diversity than disadvantaged Armenians, Moldovans, Slovakians, Kurds or scores of other minority groups with unique cultures, histories and perspectives.
In the name of diversity, such heterogeneous minority groups disappear and magically become a homogenous majority by the statistical sleight of hand of classifying them as “white,” as if this arbitrary social construct has a genetic basis. If this ethnocultural malpractice is taught in anthropology classes at Harvard, students should demand a reimbursement of their tuition.

2020/11/21,Poor Countries Still Need Hydrocarbon Fuels,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/poor-countries-still-need-hydrocarbon-fuels-11606150227,"The case for investment in renewables versus hydrocarbons is more nuanced and global than presented in “Investors Bet on Transition to Green Energy” (Markets, Nov. 11). The pandemic has revealed great unevenness in energy access within and between countries. Tremendous imbalances exist in energy choices across geographies and societies about who actually receives enough energy and the price society pays for it. Simple and devastating facts often get overlooked: 850 million people have no access to electricity whatsoever, and 3.5 billion people lack energy for clean cooking. 
Recovery will take more than a vaccine and will require global investment in all energy sources, including hydrocarbons and more demand-driven solutions. Energy is the ultimate connector of human hopes and fears; it interconnects people and places across the globe and determines quality of life. Even in the so-called “race to zero,” energy is a bigger story than just carbon.
An honest and inclusive conversation is needed about how societies can manage the full costs of accelerating the pace of energy transition and recovery from the pandemic. It is time for a new narrative, free of the politics of polarization, which works to humanize energy.

2020/11/22,The Price of Bad Polling,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-bad-polling-11606084656,"The 2020 polling autopsies are still being written, and there are many unanswered questions: How did Republicans win 27 of 27 House districts identified as tossups by the Cook Political Report? How did Sen. Susan Collins win Maine by nine points when she didn’t lead in a single major poll for months? How are President Trump and Joe Biden separated by a little under four points in the national popular vote when Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight average showed an 8.4-point Biden lead on Election Day?
The NYU economist Arpit Gupta compared the FiveThirtyEight presidential forecast to that of online betting markets, where people trade contracts reflecting the likelihood a candidate will win. He found that the “markets are pretty well calibrated—state markets that have an estimate of 50% are, in fact, tossups in the election. 538 is at least 20 points off—if 538 says that a state has a ~74% chance of going for Democrats, it really is a tossup.” 
Prediction markets aren’t perfect, and some are so thinly traded that they can move with a few bets. But at least everyone knows they’re bets. The polling industry and statistical models make claims to objective expertise, yet they again clearly missed Republican strength.
Combined with media conformity, this can lead pundits and the public astray. The prognosticators make projections—shaped by assumptions about demographics, turnout and response rates—which influence the press. These views are reinforced on social media, especially Twitter. Everyone runs in the same direction, and the press sets the conversation in a way that can further influence pollsters and campaign decisions.
Consider the impact. Radical Democratic ideas like court-packing may not have received as much backing from party leadership if forecasts had been more realistic about Democratic odds of winning Senate seats in Iowa, and North Carolina as well as House seats in Florida, California and Texas. That warped discourse may have increased polarization.
The predictions that Democrats would gain 10-15 seats or more in the House were so wrong that they may have hurt the GOP chances to take House control in what was a very close result. The Cook Political Report, which is taken as gospel by the media, was notably wrong about GOP prospects. Charlie Cook says he and his team were misled by the polls. 
“In my judgment, there was a blue wave building, a pretty big one, then something happened, like a fish getting spooked before taking a bite out of a lure,” Mr. Cook explained. “Too many of the most experienced political operatives in both parties could see it coming. My guess is that while a majority, albeit a small one, wanted to unseat Trump, they got skittish about giving Democrats unified control.”
Something happened all right. But if he’s right that polls misled him, then the Cook Political Report has no special claim to expertise. Yet its estimates influence the flow of campaign cash. The Chamber of Commerce endorsed 23 House Democrats this year, in part because it anticipated having to work with a larger Democratic majority, and it may have saved Nancy Pelosi’s Speakership. 
The GOP was heavily outspent, yet it may gain as many as 12 net seats in the House. What might have happened if Mr. Cook and his House analyst, David Wasserman, had been more accurate and said the battle for House control would be close? 
And who knows how the perception that states like Ohio were close at the presidential level (Mr. Trump won by eight) affected voter turnout. It could have mobilized Trump voters—or demoralized them. While Mr. Biden can tout a convincing popular-vote victory, Mr. Trump would have tied the Electoral College and thrown the election to the House by closing a gap under one percentage point in Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin (where a Washington Post-ABC poll released Oct. 28 had Mr. Biden up 17).
Pollsters are working on better models, but it would be healthier if politics and media narratives were shaped less by instant snapshots of quantified opinion. Public figures could make decisions based more on what they think is right. Journalists and opinion leaders could develop insights on popular sentiment the old-fashioned way—by actual reporting. Those insights might also be shaped by bias, but at least they wouldn’t be presented with an imprimatur of scientific authority.

2020/11/22,The Dividend Tax Canary,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dividend-tax-canary-11606084595,"Financial markets have breathed easier at the prospect that a GOP Senate means no big tax increases in 2021. But Republican control still isn’t certain, and one signal of caution to watch are companies issuing special dividends by the end of the year.
Costco last week announced a one-time dividend of $10 a share for an outlay of some $4.4 billion. The dividend is payable on Dec. 11. Costco has issued special dividends before, and it mentioned no political motive in the timing of the payout. 
But the dividend date this calendar year means that Costco’s holders will pay the current top tax rate on dividends of 23.8%, including the ObamaCare investment surcharge. If the wholesaler waited until next year, the tax on dividends could be much higher.
 Joe Biden has proposed raising the tax rate on dividends to the regular income tax rate that he also wants to raise to 39.6%, plus the ObamaCare surcharge. That would be a little less than double the current dividend tax rate. Mr. Biden also wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, which all adds up to a huge tax increase on capital. Corporate profits are taxed twice—first as corporate profits, then as dividends. 
 Daniel Clifton of the Strategas Group points out that more than 1,100 companies paid special dividends in late 2012 ahead of Barack Obama’s big 2013 tax increase. A similar surge is possible if polls begin to trend away from the two GOP candidates in the Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia. Mr. Clifton reports that the number of Russell 3000 companies paying a special dividend is already up 45% from a year ago.
If companies have the spare cash, they probably owe it to investors to pay the money now rather than waiting. The issue is trickier for investors with unrealized capital gains. Mr. Biden has also promised to raise the 23.8% capital-gains tax to the personal income rate. Do you sell and take the sure gain at the lower rate even if you like the investment? Or take the risk that your tax rate will nearly double if the GOP fails to hold the Senate?
A Democratic Senate is possible, especially with President Trump attacking his party leaders in Georgia because they aren’t cheering his claims of fraud. The rest of this year is a collar-tugger for investors.

2020/11/22,Republican Life in California,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-life-in-california-11606084537,"Democrats lost at least three House seats and several referenda campaigns in California in this month’s election. In another noteworthy surprise, Republican Kevin Lincoln unseated Democratic Mayor Michael Tubbs in the predominantly working-class, minority city of Stockton. What was that about the GOP becoming obsolete in the Golden State?
Four years ago, the 30-year-old Mr. Tubbs became the city’s youngest and first elected black mayor, garnering endorsements from Oprah Winfrey and Barack Obama. The Stockton native turned heads with a personal biography of overcoming poverty and difficult family circumstance, including a father in prison, to earn a degree from Stanford. 
His success story inspired voters in the city long plagued by financial problems, crime and poverty that is more similar to Detroit than San Francisco, which is fewer than 100 miles away. Only about 20% of Stockton residents are white. More than 20% live in poverty—nearly twice as many as statewide—and only 17.7% have a bachelor’s degrees compared to 33.3% of Californians. Its violent crime rate is three times higher than the state’s.
Mr. Tubbs sought to turn around the city with a “universal basic income” funded by private philanthropy that guaranteed low-income folks $500 in cash a month. Progressives have increasingly promoted this idea as a cure for inequality. He also implemented a public-safety program that paid violent offenders not to commit crimes. 
Neither initiative worked. Violence hasn’t declined since 2016, and homicides were up 40% in October from a year earlier. Homelessness increased three-fold from 2017 to 2019.
Enter the 40-year-old Mr. Lincoln, a Latino-black Marine veteran who served as a pastor at a local church. The Republican issued papers detailing his plans to tackle public disorder, including more police on the street and public-private cooperation to build more shelters for the homeless. These ideas aren’t novel, though they often defy liberal orthodoxy and were spurned by Mr. Tubbs. 
What do you know? Low-income and minority voters prefer safe and clean streets to government handouts. Mr. Lincoln defeated the Democratic incumbent by 12 points. His victory offers proof that Republicans can win in California with attractive and diverse candidates who speak to everyday voter concerns, especially as Democrats cater more and more to the cultural indulgences of the gentry left.

2020/11/22,Some Masks Will Protect You Better Than Others,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-masks-will-protect-you-better-than-others-11606081251,"A rush of travel for Thanksgiving will lead to new Covid-19 outbreaks. Infection rates are accelerating, and a growing percentage of those hospitalized are over 65. Past waves prompted people to reduce their activity, but recent Google mobility data don’t show a big change in behavior. Yet many Americans could take one simple step to protect themselves: Buy a better mask.
The widespread use of masks has become an unfortunate flashpoint in the political debate over how seriously to take Covid. Naysayers argue that the masks won’t protect you, so why bother wearing them? The premise is false, but the level of protection depends on the type of the mask.
I was part of the discussion with the government in the spring around the merits of federal guidance recommending people wear masks when they go out. A lot of Covid spread comes from people who are asymptomatic and don’t know they are infected. The thinking was that if more people wore masks, that could reduce the spread. For these purposes, data showed that many types of face covering could reduce transmission.
Back then, medical masks were in short supply. As a compromise, the public was advised to use cloth masks. The supply chain has since expanded, and while there are still some shortages of medical masks, health-care workers have dedicated supply chains. It’s time to revise the guidance to consumers. 
A cotton mask offers far less protection than a surgical mask. If a cloth mask is all you can find, buy a thick one. Snug-fitting masks made of cotton-polyester blends will generally offer more protection. But even a very good cloth mask may only be about 30% protective; scarf or bandanna, 10% or less.
A surgical mask could offer you better protection, on the order of 60%. But here again, quality matters. Many of the masks sold on Amazon, which say they are for dust and allergens, aren’t surgical masks, even though they look like the blue masks worn by nurses and doctors. A real medical-procedure mask will be cleared by the Food and Drug Administration and designated as offering one of three levels of protection. Generally, a level 2 or level 3 medical mask is best. 
An N95 or equivalent mask offers the best protection and, if used properly, will filter out at least 95% of infectious particles. Online resources can help you fit the mask. In China the equivalent mask is the KN95 and in Europe the comparable designation is FFP2. The FDA has authorized for emergency use a bunch of KN95 and FFP2 masks that have been tested to show that they offer comparable protection to an N95 mask. These options are listed on the FDA’s website.
Masks may also be evaluated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that certifies masks for industrial uses. Check to see if your mask is listed in the Niosh database. Many products claim to be N95 equivalent but haven’t undergone testing and may be counterfeits.
Better-quality masks can be expensive—perhaps $5 for a single N95 mask. But having a few available for high-risk settings such as the grocery store can reduce the risk of transmission. The Department of Homeland Security has published instructions online on disinfecting and reusing N95 masks that can extend their life.
Governors can help: States can provide masks to people at high risk who can’t find them easily. They can also direct consumers to the best masks they can source. The FDA and CDC typically weigh in on the quality of masks when a manufacturer seeks federal review or sells a mask for medical use. But state agencies have more latitude to speak to the full range of products sold to consumers online.
Slowing the current cycle of spread will be difficult. But encouraging Americans to wear higher-quality masks is a simple step that might make a difference.

2020/11/22,Nationwide Injunctions Will Be a Vital Check if Biden Overreaches,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/nationwide-injunctions-will-be-a-vital-check-if-biden-overreaches-11606081224,"Federal district judges have frustrated the Trump administration by issuing nationwide injunctions against dozens of agency actions. The Supreme Court will consider a case this term that could determine when, if ever, judges can issue these universal injunctions, which apply beyond the geographic limits of the court’s jurisdiction.
At the same time, with Republicans expected to control the Senate next year, President-elect Biden plans executive actions to bypass Congress and decree sweeping regulatory changes affecting nearly every U.S. industry. For the next four years, conservatives will be apt to seek nationwide injunctions—and courts should continue issuing them as a vital check on executive-branch overreach.
As Texas solicitor general, I successfully petitioned for multiple nationwide injunctions against the Obama administration. Courts issued some three times as many nationwide injunctions against the Trump administration in four years as they did throughout all eight years of the Obama administration. Yet I have maintained that courts have the power to enter these injunctions in appropriate cases.
There is no doubt that nationwide injunctions are powerful remedies. They allow a single judge to nullify a federal administrative agency’s policy across the entire nation instead of blocking its enforcement against only the parties bringing the lawsuit, or only in the state or part of a state under the court’s jurisdiction. 
Courts should issue nationwide injunctions sparingly. When an agency’s action is lawful in some circumstances but not others, courts shouldn’t block the policy categorically across the country. But a court should have the power to enter a nationwide injunction against a federal agency’s action when it is categorically unlawful in all circumstances.
The argument for nationwide injunctions is stronger when courts review federal agency actions as opposed to statutes. The Supreme Court has held that Congress can delegate power to federal agencies in all sorts of contexts to make rules that carry the force of law. Each year for decades, agencies have made far more rules than Congress has enacted bills. So the conditions Congress places on agency authority often dictate which branch of the federal government has the power to regulate entire industries.
The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, which delineates the conditions under which Congress agrees to give power to executive-branch agencies, directly supports nationwide injunctions. While setting conditions on administrative authority, Congress also broadly allowed lawsuits against federal agencies and gave courts substantial power to rein in invalid agency actions. The law provides that a “reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that exceeds the agency’s authority. There is considerable historical evidence that “set aside” in this context means nullifying entire governmental actions. At the Constitutional Convention, James Madison described the power to “set aside” governmental actions as a judicial veto power over whole laws. And in other statutes enacted right before the Administrative Procedure Act, Congress used the phrase “set aside” to describe a court’s nullification of congressional acts or agency rules—rather than merely blocking an enforcement action against a single litigant.
Since at least the late 1970s, the Justice Department has argued that nationwide injunctions are inconsistent with historical judicial remedies entered by “courts of equity”—the type of court under 18th-century English common law that could block parties from taking certain unlawful actions. But Congress can override historical common law practices, as it did with the Administrative Procedure Act.
The Supreme Court in 1979 held that “the scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation established.” If an agency action is categorically unlawful in all circumstances, a judge can enjoin it nationwide.
The strongest argument against nationwide injunctions is that they asymmetrically allow plaintiffs to block an agency’s action by filing multiple lawsuits. All the plaintiffs need is one judge to stop the policy. Appellate courts should strongly consider staying such injunctions pending appeal when multiple judges elsewhere have upheld the agency actions.
Yet the availability of these injunctions shouldn’t depend on who occupies the White House. Federal courts should continue to have the power to enter nationwide injunctions when Biden administration agencies act unlawfully.

2020/11/22,"Forgive Student Loans, but Only a Little",Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/forgive-student-loans-but-only-a-little-11606081191,"Student-loan cancellation may be an appealing idea, but it would enrich the privileged and leave behind—or perhaps even drain money from—the truly needy. Progressive calls for President-elect Joe Biden to forgive student debt in his first 100 days of office should be ignored in lieu of a more moderate proposal: forgiveness capped at $5,000 of debt.
Workers with a college degree are the highest paid in the economy and the last to get laid off during a downturn. Sure, having debt is worse than not having debt. But because of the large financial returns to postsecondary education, folks with debt and a degree are often better off than those who have neither. It’s clear in the data: Borrowers with the largest balances are the least likely to default. That’s because they’ve often invested in professional or graduate degrees that lead to careers with high earning potential. 
Borrowers who owe less than $5,000 are the most likely to default. Many in this category started a degree but didn’t finish, and thus aren’t enjoying the higher earnings afforded by a degree.
Then there are those with no college education. The plight of borrowers with college degrees is surely preferable to that of workers getting by on the lower wages paid to the less-educated. Many Americans without degrees come from less well-off families; a higher percentage lack emergency savings; and they are the first to be laid off in a downturn.
Each dollar spent on loan relief is a dollar raised in taxes, and far less than half of taxpayers have a four-year degree. Student-loan cancellation would bleed the working class to alleviate debt for those with more-lucrative career options. The progressive nature of the existing tax code helps to focus the payment burden on the more affluent, but the spending would still drain resources that could otherwise be spent on programs benefiting those with greater needs.
That brings us back to my proposal, a $5,000 student-loan jubilee in the form of a one-time tax credit. That would ensure that most borrowers who are truly up a creek can escape debt and move on with their lives. And such a proposal would buy the government the time, and perhaps the political leeway, to pass legislation that would streamline the existing student-loan repayment programs and ensure that struggling borrowers with large balances who are eligible would have the time to enroll in them. Washington could even expand those programs to require borrowers to pay a smaller fraction of their monthly income to loan repayment or allow debts to be forgiven sooner. At least these changes would ensure that dollars spent on loan relief flow to those that need them most. 
More than half of Americans have built their lives and made ends meet without a college degree. Call universal student loan cancellation what it is: elitist.

2020/11/22,Notable & Quotable: Trump in 2024,Notable & Quotable,https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-trump-in-2024-11606081155,"Philip Klein writing for the Washington Examiner, Nov. 16:
What if Trump runs again in 2024? . . . If Trump has one weakness in 2024, it would be that he lost the 2020 election to an aging Biden even as Republicans made gains down ballot. That’s a sure sign that many voters who weren’t on board with Democrats on policy decided to hold their noses and vote for Biden simply because they could not stand Trump. Do Republicans want to renominate Trump in 2024 and risk another defeat?
The problem for Republicans is that this argument only works if Republican voters think that Trump lost. If they think he actually won and the election was stolen, that argument no longer works as well. . . .
There will be a point at which Trump has exhausted all legal options, and Biden still remains ahead. There will be a point at which Biden will be certified as the winner by the Electoral College. Assuming Trump still refuses to concede at that point and that he claims that he actually won but it was stolen from him, Republicans will have another opportunity to stand up to Trump and acknowledge that Biden is the legitimate winner. They will no longer be able to hide behind the idea of letting the legal process play out or to say that Biden was only declared the winner by the media. If they back Trump at that point, it could come back to haunt them in 2024.

2020/11/22,Populism and Politics in Peru,The Americas,https://www.wsj.com/articles/populism-and-politics-in-peru-11606081128,"Millions of Peruvians have lifted themselves out of poverty in the past two decades, thanks to a more open and market-oriented economy yielding fast growth. Socialists don’t like it. But they have been unable to reverse the laws underpinning the country’s progress. Now they’re using the latest political crisis to make another try.
Peru’s rampant corruption is again on the front burner. Coming amid the Covid-19 pandemic and a deep recession, it has raised the ire of the nation.
Yet it’s hard to see how an electorate that so often votes for populism at the polls can extricate itself from the grasp of crooked politicians. The hard left’s solution, which is to rewrite the 1993 constitution and give the state a larger role in the economy, would make things worse.

 Francisco Sagasti was sworn in as interim president Tuesday. The center-left former lawmaker replaces interim President Manuel Merino, who only a week earlier had replaced President Martín Vizcarra, who in 2018 replaced President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who resigned amid allegations of corruption. With me so far?
The civilian government has mostly followed the law, the line of succession has been more or less respected, and an April election for a new president is on schedule. That’s the good news. But it’s been a bumpy ride. 
Mr. Vizcarra had no vice president when he was impeached by a 105-19 vote in the unicameral legislature earlier this month. As the head of Congress, Mr. Merino was next in the line for the job. But Peruvians who didn’t approve of the impeachment took to the streets in protest. Two people died in violent clashes with police. In an effort to restore calm, Mr. Merino agreed to step aside and let Congress choose a caretaker president. 
Hard-left lawmaker Rocío Silva-Santisteban ran for the post unopposed, but she couldn’t garner enough support from her peers to win when her candidacy was put to a vote. A day later Mr. Sagasti—of the moderate Purple Party, which had opposed Mr. Vizcarra’s removal—won congressional approval. The streets are calm—for now. 
Vizcarra supporters say he is a victim of congressional abuse of power. But he may have made his own bed in September 2019 when he unilaterally dissolved Congress. 
The constitution allows a president to send legislators home and schedule new elections if they give him two votes of no confidence. One had already occurred. Then, on Sept. 30, 2019, Congress named a new Constitutional Court justice—which is its prerogative—ahead of considering a judicial reform he had proposed. Piqued by the move, Mr. Vizcarra declared it a “de facto” second vote of no confidence even though no such vote had occurred. Scholars are still debating the legality of that decision, though the high court voted 4-3 in the president’s favor in January. 
Mr. Vizcarra ruled by decree for five months. His relationship with the new Congress elected in January wasn’t much better. In September lawmakers released audiotapes that allegedly exposed witness tampering on the part of the president, but a subsequent impeachment vote failed. 
After whistleblowers came forward alleging Mr. Vizcarra took bribes while he was governor of the Moquegua region from 2011-14, a second vote to impeach succeeded. 
Technically Mr. Vizcarra was removed on grounds of “moral incapacity,” the same tool used to impeach President Alberto Fujimori in 2000. Mr. Vizcarra is crying foul because he has not been convicted of a crime. But impeachment in Peru is a political process, as it is in the U.S. and most other countries. Even the high court, which leans in Mr. Vizcarra’s favor, ruled last week that his removal is constitutional. 
Plus, as a self-described champion of anticorruption, Mr. Vizcarra needed to be squeaky clean. A judge has barred him from leaving the country and prosecutors have charged him with aggravated collusion, bribery and illicit association to commit a crime. Mr. Vizcarra maintains his innocence.
Peruvians are frustrated. They have been told that by voting they can secure an honest government. But elected officials repeatedly turn out to be self-interested and corrupt. The public perennially mistakes its dashed hopes as a problem of the wrong people in the job. Yet as fast as they throw the bums out and bring in new ones, more scandals arise. 
At the core of this dysfunction is a state with vast powers to redistribute wealth. The incentives to maintain the status quo are significant. Even voters who say they want less corruption may find that change conflicts with their self-interest. The siren song of populism draws them to politicians who can hand out plenty of government jobs and other goodies in a world of weak institutional checks.
That such power is abused is as predictable as human nature itself. So too is Peru’s grim future if the statist rabble-rousers demanding a new constitution prevail.

2020/11/22,Maybe Not So Shockingly Moderate After All,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/maybe-not-so-shockingly-moderate-after-all-11606076438,"Regarding Mark Penn’s “America’s Shockingly Moderate Electorate” (op-ed, Nov. 17): Mr. Penn states, “Moderate men swung the race to Mr. Biden.” He bases this on Mr. Trump’s advantage among white men narrowing from 30 points to 23 and Mr. Biden expanding the lead among moderates to 30 points from 12 in 2016. Contrary to this, Gerald Seib’s “Big Year for Women Suggests a New Era” (Capital Journal, Nov. 17) says, “Women voters were responsible for Mr. Biden’s victory.” He bases this on women making up 53% of the electorate and that one survey showed them going for Mr. Biden by 55% to 44%. It seems that the 11-point margin among women rather than the shift of moderate men is more likely to be the deciding factor.

Had President Trump performed as well in communicating effectively about his handling of the Covid virus as he did in dealing with it, Joe Biden would have lost. After all, most Americans don’t expect perfection, just the knowledge that a problem is being dealt with.
Richard Muchow

The one-factor analysis (i.e., moderate voters seized the day) by Mr. Penn produces a feel-good narrative that has an element of truth but is shockingly simplistic and misleading. If it was moderate voters who tipped Mr. Biden over the top in a close race, those moderates were mostly in groups that tilted Democratic in several election cycles.
The Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force agenda that mollified the democratic-socialist wing of Vice President Biden’s party is by no means moderate. Joe Biden mostly clammed up about or disavowed the Unity Task Force policies because they are not the types of compromises that Mr. Penn says voters want.
Relying on a Democratic pollster to define what it means to be a moderate is dicey. One guesses that most Americans want to think of themselves as reasonable moderates (regardless of their views) and that someone to their left or right isn’t moderate. 
Jeff Adams
Atlanta
For Mr. Penn to suggest that moderates swung the election to Joe Biden because they are “moderate” is unsupported by the facts. Like or hate Donald Trump, there was no mistake on where he stood. Joe Biden, on the other hand, presented exactly zero substantive information concerning his presidential policy intentions. Voters heard nothing more than vague generalities, outright refusals to commit to a position and Covid, Covid, Covid. In his 47 years in Washington Joe Biden has a documented record of pandering to the moment. How can anyone, especially the groups alleged to have swung to the former vice president, reasonably suggest that a vote for Mr. Biden was a demonstration of moderate principles?

Larry Hogan’s “Biden’s Mandate for Moderation” (op-ed, Nov. 9) exhibits a huge blind spot or perhaps a significant loss of memory. As I recall, the call for resistance and divisiveness originated with the Democratic Party before Donald Trump even took office and persisted nonstop for four years. It is interesting to now hear all these calls for unity coming from the resistance party. What goes around comes around. Welcome to the real world.

2020/11/22,Many Latinos Liked Trump’s Antisocialism,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/many-latinos-liked-trumps-antisocialism-11606076382,"Jason Riley ends “Blacks and Latinos for Trump” (Upward Mobility, Nov. 11) with the conclusion that the focus of reopening during Covid times is what may have resonated in the Latino uptick of votes for President Trump. That may be a reason, but as a Latino living in the Venezuelan/Colombian-American area of Doral, Fla., I can tell you that Mr. Trump’s campaign was able to, on one hand, sell the idea that a Joe Biden administration would be a Trojan horse for socialism. Many Venezuelan-Americans, who fled the failed socialism in Venezuela, are terrified with the prospect of living in that situation again. On the other hand, Mr. Trump also sold Venezuelans the idea that his administration would be able to liberate Venezuela from the dictator Nicolás Maduro and his cronies, and many Venezuelans perceived that Mr. Biden would go back to the Cuba-friendly policies of the Obama era and not make an effort to liberate Venezuela from dictatorship. 
As a Venezuelan-American, but first as an American, I trust American institutions and their checks and balances and am not afraid of a “socialist takeover” in our country. I also firmly believe that Venezuelans need to fight harder to remove Mr. Maduro. If that’s the Venezuelan people’s ultimate wish, then other countries may join in support. Ask any Latinos here in Miami why they supported President Trump and you would realize that fear of communism or socialism played a major role in their decision, maybe even more than economic reasons.

2020/11/22,Bolton and Avoiding a China-Taiwan War,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/john-bolton-and-avoiding-a-china-taiwan-war-11606076329,"John Bolton’s review of “The China Nightmare” (Bookshelf, Nov. 16) offers compelling reasons to integrate Dan Blumenthal’s book into the current China foreign-policy framework. However, Mr. Bolton’s framing of the Taiwan issue skirts key elements of that global flashpoint. Recognition of Taiwan wouldn’t lead to a dramatic “chill” with China, but the fundamental collapse of diplomatic relations. In fact, the One China consensus of 1972 (which stated that there was only one legitimate Chinese government) was the basis for normalizing relations with China in 1979. It is highly likely that U.S. recognition of Taiwan as a sovereign state would be a casus belli for China’s invasion of the island. 
The Taiwan Relations Act, albeit a cornerstone of the current de facto alliance with Taiwan, remains relatively ambiguous in comparison to U.S. defense obligations with NATO and other key allies. Unless the U.S. decides to enter into a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan (a likely uphill political battle given the current aversion to foreign wars), it would likely suffer the same fate as that of Ukraine and Hong Kong.

Erika Komisar’s “Lockdowns Have a Bright Side for Teens” (op-ed, Nov. 18) on reduced depression in teens during the pandemic is encouraging and its point well taken regarding the value of family time and sleep, so often overlooked during the developmental years. However, her argument that standardized tests should be permanently removed so as to reduce anxiety in teens is mistaken. There are other more effective ways to help teens cope with the inevitable anxieties that recur. 
Removing all roadblocks, challenges and hardships is no way to build resilience. In fact, it is anathema to developing the adaptiveness one needs to face the real world.

2020/11/22,Gambling Is the Only Game in Town,Inside View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/gambling-is-the-only-game-in-town-11606069340,"As I headed home from college for Thanksgiving, a foreign student staying the weekend asked about the holiday’s meaning. I quickly answered, “Food, family and football.” He said he understood the first two but not football. Another friend piped in, “To enjoy it, you gotta have a little action going on the games.” So I took the Cowboys over the team formerly known as the Redskins (hopefully they’ll be renamed the Washington Swampers soon). We had to explain spreads and over/under—like teaching a baby to walk.
A little action helps. I was in a sports bar during college basketball’s March Madness when all the games were pretty much over, and then Northeast Louisiana hit a bucket at the buzzer to lose by only 8 with the spread at 9. I stood up and screamed and got a lot of funny looks. Yes, interest definitely turns into commitment. But I wonder if it’s gone too far.

No question that gambling is fun, but it’s not for everyone. You used to have to go to a casino, see a bent-nose bookie—I’ve got a horse right here, his name is Paul Revere —or physically write down your picks for a friend’s football pool. Technology makes it so easy to bet—too easy. At any age. I worry.
Professional leagues have a rude history with betting: Raiders quarterback Kenny Stabler’s relationship with a “well-known New Jersey gambling figure,” National Basketball Association referee Tim Donaghy’s prison time for betting and manipulating scores, and Pete Rose’s ban for life for betting on baseball. Temptation is too alluring. But who cares now? Heck, the Raiders play in Las Vegas! Wanna bet all professional leagues embrace gambling as another revenue stream?
Now everyone is gambling. Online poker is addictive, until you lose. After the lockdown drought, sports blissfully came back, as did betting. Even formerly family-friendly fantasy football leagues are now big business. Betting operator DraftKings saw users up 64% and revenues almost double from last year’s third quarter. If, like me, you wonder how this is possible, New Jersey won a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that allowed states to legalize sports betting. Bits easily cross borders to bet. The spigots have opened.
Lotteries are still a monster business, despite the truism that the lottery is a tax on people who don’t understand statistics. Same for casinos. I remember when New Jersey legalized gambling in Atlantic City. Soon after the Resorts Casino Hotel opened in 1978, the press was all over a story about a single mother on welfare who won a million-dollar jackpot playing dollar slot machines. It was a feel-good story for a day, until opinion pages started clucking, Uh, what the heck is a single welfare mother doing gambling at dollar slot machines? What indeed.
For the most part, I stay away from casinos or only play games where I have an advantage, like craps (OK, kidding). Once at an offshore casino, I taught a young son how to play blackjack. Feel free to question my parenting. He jubilantly found me later, saying he won $80. I looked him in the eye and explained, “yeah, that’s not your money. You’re only holding on to it until you eventually lose it back to casinos.”
In October 1987, I went with some colleagues to see Mike Tyson beat up Tyrell Biggs, presented by, yes, the Trump Plaza Atlantic City. We played blackjack afterward and the dealer, when he heard we were from Wall Street, asked, “Why would you guys come here? You work at the biggest casino in the world.” That’s never truer than now. Oh, and the market crashed that Monday.
Years later in the City of Lost Wages for a concert, I wandered into a sports book. Duke was at 10-to-1 odds to win the NCAA basketball championship. So I bet $100 and gave the ticket to my son at Christmas, who was a senior there. Duke won it all and now I don’t have to buy him presents for a decade.
People gamble on elections, celebrity baby names—heck, on almost anything, including whether an umpire’s baseball roll between innings will end up on the mound or back on the grass. Parleys, arbitrage, buying points—things can get very complicated separating you and your money.
I try to keep it simple, like football pools. There’s an app for that—no messy bookies. I’m in an NFL pick ’em pool, so I actually care about every game, and diligently watch Andrew Siciliano on DirectTV’s RedZone channel. I even won week five. I’ll just leave my winnings sitting in my Venmo account until the gambling gods take them back someday. Like everything else, moderation is good. But a little action goes a long way, especially on Thanksgiving. And not odd-sounding at all in 2020, I like the Football Team and the points.

2020/11/22,The Inauthenticity Behind Black Lives Matter,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-inauthenticity-behind-black-lives-matter-11606069287," Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina gave a remarkable speech at this year’s Republican National Convention. Yes, here was a black man at a GOP event, so there was a whiff of identity politics. When we see color these days, we expect ideology to follow. But Mr. Scott’s charisma that night was simply that he spoke as a person, not a spokesperson for his color.
 Burgess Owens, Herschel Walker, Daniel Cameron and several others did the same. It was a parade of individuals. And in their speeches the human being stepped out from behind the identity, telling personal stories that reached for human connections with the American people—this rather than the usual posturing for leverage with tales of grievance. So they were all fresh and compelling. 
Do these Republicans foretell a new racial order in America? Clearly they have pushed their way through an old racial order, as have—it could be argued—many black Trump voters in the recent election. I believe there is in fact a new racial order slowly and tenuously emerging, and that we blacks are swimming through rough seas to reach it. But to better see the new, it is necessary to know the old. 
The old began in what might be called America’s Great Confession. In passing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, America effectively confessed to a long and terrible collusion with the evil of racism. (President Kennedy was the first president to acknowledge that civil rights was a “moral issue.”) This triggered nothing less than a crisis of moral authority that threatened the very legitimacy of American democracy. 
Even today, almost 60 years beyond the Civil Rights Act, groups like Black Lives Matter, along with a vast grievance industry, use America’s insecure moral authority around race as an opportunity to assert themselves. Doesn’t BLM dwell in a space made for it by America’s racial self-doubt? 
In the culture, whites and American institutions are effectively mandated by this confession to prove their innocence of racism as a condition of moral legitimacy. Blacks, in turn, are mandated to honor their new freedom by developing into educational and economic parity with whites. If whites achieve racial innocence and blacks develop into parity with whites, then America will have overcome its original sin. Democracy will have become manifest. 
This was America’s post-confession bargain between the races—innocence on the white hand, development on the black. It defined the old order with which those convention speakers seemed to break. But there is a problem with these mandates: To achieve their ends, they both need blacks to be victims. Whites need blacks they can save to prove their innocence of racism. Blacks must put themselves forward as victims the better to make their case for entitlements.
This is a corruption because it makes black suffering into a moral power to be wielded, rather than a condition to be overcome. This is the power that blacks discovered in the ’60s. It gained us a War on Poverty, affirmative action, school busing, public housing and so on. But it also seduced us into turning our identity into a virtual cult of victimization—as if our persecution was our eternal flame, the deepest truth of who we are, a tragic fate we trade on. After all, in an indifferent world, it may feel better to be the victim of a great historical injustice than a person left out of history when that injustice recedes. 
Yet there is an elephant in the room. It is simply that we blacks aren’t much victimized any more. Today we are free to build a life that won’t be stunted by racial persecution. Today we are far more likely to encounter racial preferences than racial discrimination. Moreover, we live in a society that generally shows us goodwill—a society that has isolated racism as its most unforgivable sin. 
This lack of victimization amounts to an “absence of malice” that profoundly threatens the victim-focused black identity. Who are we without the malice of racism? Can we be black without being victims? The great diminishment (not eradication) of racism since the ’60s means that our victim-focused identity has become an anachronism. Well suited for the past, it strains for relevance in the present. 
Thus, for many blacks today—especially the young—there is a feeling of inauthenticity, that one is only thinly black because one isn’t racially persecuted. “Systemic racism” is a term that tries to recover authenticity for a less and less convincing black identity. This racism is really more compensatory than systemic. It was invented to make up for the increasing absence of the real thing. 
This summer, in cities from Portland, Ore., to Baltimore, black protest seemed driven more by the angst of inauthenticity than by any real menace. The protests themselves came off as theater. There were costumes, masks and well-rehearsed mimes of confrontation and outrage. The violence was destructive, but only to a point. After all it was calibrated to go on for months. In the summer of 2020, self-consciousness replaced spontaneity as the essence of youthful protest in America—yet another sign that there is not enough real victimization to light the sort of fire that burned down Detroit in the ’60s. 
I doubt that any of the black speakers at the RNC would argue that racism has vanished from American life. What makes them harbingers of a new racial order is that they unpair victimization from identity. Victimization may be an experience we endure, but it should never be an identity that defines us. They all spoke as American citizens in a spirit of citizenship.
This is the great challenge that always awaits the oppressed after freedom is achieved. If only out of loyalty to our past (all this suffering has to mean something), we will feel compelled to make victimization the centerpiece of our identity today. This will seem the authentic and honorable thing to do. But it will only further invest us in precisely the fruitless tangle of identity and woundedness that mires us in the past. We should never deny the past, but it should only inform and inspire.
In the end, only one achievement will turn us from the old victim-focused racial order toward a new, nonracial order: the full and unqualified acceptance of our freedom. We don’t have to fight for freedom so much any more. We have to do something more difficult—fully accept that we are free.

2020/11/23,Biden’s Liberal Internationalists,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-liberal-internationalists-11606175044,"Joe Biden is wasting no time selecting his governing team, and the initial choices for national security posts that he announced on Monday are heavy with Obama Administration veterans. This means they’ll know how to run a government, though we hope he plans better than a restoration of the status quo pre- Donald Trump. 
Mr. Biden’s choices of Antony Blinken to run the State Department and Jake Sullivan as national security adviser will reassure world leaders discomfited by Mr. Trump’s disruption. Mr. Blinken has worked with Mr. Biden for years, which will give him significant policy influence. Mr. Sullivan worked with Hillary Clinton at the State Department and would have had a major job had she won the Presidency. 
Both are mainstream liberal internationalists who believe in working on behalf of U.S. interests through multilateral institutions. They favor U.S. leadership as long as it is channeled through the United Nations, NATO and traditional alliances. To borrow a phrase from the Obama era, they favor leading from behind. They’re also enamored with arms control, and Mr. Sullivan criticized Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the 1987 nuclear arms treaty with Russia despite blatant Kremlin cheating.
On the other hand, they were on the more hawkish side of some Obama-era debates. Mr. Sullivan supported antitank missiles for Ukraine, which President Obama opposed and Mr. Trump finally delivered. Mr. Blinken favored the Iraq war in 2002 and intervention in Libya. Mr. Blinken was known for repeating like a mantra, “superpowers don’t bluff,” regarding Mr. Obama’s red-line fiasco about the use of chemical weapons in Syria. 
If Michèle Flournoy is Mr. Biden’s choice for defense secretary, as many expect, he will have a team that might stand up better than Mr. Obama did to adversaries. The caveat is China, where the former Vice President and his advisers haven’t revealed their thinking to any significant degree. It will be their toughest problem, not least because domestic U.S. politics won’t let them return to Mr. Obama’s policy of wagging a finger but doing nothing to deter Beijing’s rogue behavior.
We’re less familiar with Mr. Biden’s nominee for Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, or Avril Haines, who will be director of national intelligence. We do know both deserve better than to be described as “the first Latino” to run DHS, or the “first woman” at DNI, as the press insisted on describing them. The media’s insipid preoccupation with identity politics obscures what’s important. How about what they think? 
The big disappointment is John Kerry as a cabinet-level special envoy for climate. As a negotiator, Mr. Kerry never drives a hard bargain, as his Iran nuclear deal showed. His cabinet status suggests that climate will be a special negotiating priority rather than one issue among many in foreign policy. Why can’t Mr. Blinken handle it?
Perhaps this is meant to be diplomatic theater to appease the climate left. But it is a bad signal if Mr. Biden considers climate to be a leading national security issue. The fracking-led boom in U.S. oil and gas production has enhanced American security in multiple ways. 
It has made the U.S. less dependent on foreign producers and the U.S. economy less hostage to the vagaries of the world oil market. The fall in oil prices, thanks in part to U.S. production, has reduced the clout of dictators in oil-producing countries like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro. U.S. natural gas sales also enhance America’s exports and economic influence.
Mr. Biden has pledged to return the U.S. to the Paris climate accord, which would be a boon to China. Under that agreement the People’s Republic doesn’t have to reduce carbon emissions at all until 2030, while the U.S. will have to impose vast new rules to cut emissions. 
Chinese leaders will be only too happy to make future promises on climate in return for American acquiescence today to their security priorities of Taiwan, the South China Sea and Huawei. Sending Mr. Kerry to negotiate with Chinese President Xi Jinping on climate is a recipe for returning home dressed in a barrel. An obsession with climate will turn a U.S. security strength into a vulnerability.

2020/11/23,A Buckeye Voucher Victory,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-buckeye-voucher-victory-11606174978,"The pandemic has been especially tough on low- and middle-income families, but the GOP Legislature in Ohio has given parents in their state something to be grateful for this Thanksgiving by passing a major expansion of private-school vouchers.
Legislation approved late last week expands eligibility for the state’s private-school scholarship program to families earning up to 250% of the poverty line from 200%. Students in schools where at least 20% of families are low-income or that fall in the bottom 20% of academic performance for the past two years would also be eligible. The bill awaits Gov. Mike DeWine’s signature.
Half of all students in Ohio would be eligible for a scholarship. Nearly 50,000 students already receive vouchers, which average around $4,500. That’s about a third as much as the state spends per pupil at public schools. Nonetheless, the teachers union and district superintendents claim without evidence that the voucher expansion will hurt public schools.
Their real concern is that more school choice will force more accountability by increasing competition. Several studies have found that academic performance improves at public schools in areas where more students qualify for vouchers, so even those who don’t receive scholarships may benefit from the Ohio legislation. 
It’s notable that Republicans this year performed better among minorities in states where they’ve expanded school choice. According to exit polls, about 40% of Hispanics voted for President Trump in Ohio and North Carolina, where the GOP Legislature in September pushed through an expansion of scholarships so more middle-class families could benefit.
A Biden Administration might try to limit school choice, but it will face strong resistance to its unions-first agenda in the states where Republicans next year will control the legislature. Republicans also have an opportunity to retake governorships in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan in 2022, and expanding school choice is a winner politically.

2020/11/23,A Fed Chair for Treasury,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-fed-chair-for-treasury-11606174940,"Once upon a time Democrats chose Wall Street or business veterans for the Treasury, with a goal of reassuring the private capital markets. Jack Kennedy chose Wall Streeter Douglas Dillon while Jimmy Carter picked Michael Blumenthal of Bendix. These days Democratic Presidents lean toward Washington experience, which helps explain Joe Biden’s leaked choice on Monday of Janet Yellen to be his Treasury secretary.
Ms. Yellen is an economist by training but she’s a political economist by experience. Most recently she was Chair of the Federal Reserve during President Obama’s second term. But she has also done stints as president of the San Francisco Fed and the White House Council of Economic Advisers. That’s a gold-plated political resume, and she has a reputation for always knowing her brief. 
She trained under economist James Tobin at Yale and throughout her long career she has followed the Tobin precepts of easy money, with generous social spending financed by tax increases. She believes in the Keynesian precept that federal spending spurs economic growth—the kind of spending matters less than the amount—and in recent months has called for much more in federal Covid-19 relief. This no doubt appeals to Mr. Biden, who is fond of the Obama spending spree of 2009-2010, and it will certainly make Ms. Yellen a popular choice among Democrats on Capitol Hill. 
Our guess is that Mr. Biden also values her ties to the Fed, which is expanding its policy writ to include vast new regulatory powers, as well as a larger role in fiscal policy and steering the allocation of private capital with its loans and bond purchases. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took the courageous step last week of ending the Fed’s extraordinary pandemic-related powers under the Cares Act, and markets have defied doom-and-gloom predictions by reacting well to the decision. But both the Fed and the Biden transition team criticized Mr. Mnuchin for taking back the Treasury money to backstop the expanded Fed programs.
Ms. Yellen worked with current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell during the Obama years, and they are likely to form a mind meld on fiscal and monetary policy. This will be good for Ms. Yellen’s policy influence, but the same can’t be said for Fed independence. 
For all of the protests about President Trump’s misguided Twitter attacks on Mr. Powell, the Fed has been moving toward becoming an arm of the Treasury for some time. Paul Volcker maintained lines of independence he wouldn’t cross. But Alan Greenspan played politics behind the scenes, Ben Bernanke was more overt in becoming a team with Tim Geithner, and Ms. Yellen and Mr. Powell have continued the pattern. 
The Fed seems to be returning to the role it played before the famous Accord in 1951 when the Board of Governors agreed with the Treasury to separate its financing of government debt from monetary policy. This created what we came to know as the modern Fed. But nowadays the Fed is financing federal debt with enthusiasm, and Mr. Powell is signaling he’ll do as much of it as the politicians want. 
With her ties to the Fed governors, and especially the Fed staff, Ms. Yellen is likely to have even more influence even than most recent Treasury chiefs. This will be a good line of inquiry at her Treasury confirmation hearing.

2020/11/23,Trump’s Campaign Runs Out of Road,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-campaign-runs-out-of-road-11606174877,"President Trump is running out of options as his campaign continues trying to contest the election. Michigan’s result was certified by a state board on Monday in a 3-0 vote, with one GOP abstention. In the biggest swing state, Pennsylvania, counties faced a deadline to certify, after a caustic ruling by a conservative federal judge on Saturday rejected the campaign’s legal claims.
In asking the court “to discard millions of votes legally cast,” Judge Matthew Brann wrote, the Trump campaign and two Pennsylvania residents might have been expected to “come formidably armed” with “factual proof of rampant corruption.” Instead the judge said he was given “strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence.”
He called one legal claim akin to a “Frankenstein’s Monster,” in being “haphazardly stitched together from two distinct theories in an attempt to avoid controlling precedent.” Judge Brann was appointed by President Obama, but he was the GOP’s reward in a judicial horse trade. Senator Pat Toomey on Saturday called him “a longtime conservative Republican whom I know to be a fair and unbiased jurist.”
The Trump team’s optimistic spin was that the loss “turns out to help us in our strategy to get expeditiously to the U.S. Supreme Court.” We’ll find out soon enough, since the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed on Monday to expedite its review. Mr. Trump is down by about 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania, which is a lot to overcome.
In Georgia, where Mr. Trump trails by 12,000, his campaign has asked for a recount of the recount. Last week the state finished tallying five million ballots by hand, in what was technically an audit. The ballots now will be run through the scanners again, though it’s difficult to imagine the third time being the charm.
Governor Brian Kemp has called for “a sample audit of signatures on the absentee ballot envelopes.” Although there’s no way to match up envelopes with specific votes, an audit isn’t necessarily a bad idea to build confidence. But Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system manager, said Monday that there isn’t a clear “legal path” for this, given that nobody has shown evidence of sweeping problems in the signature-verification process.
He said that the state is investigating specific cases of people who, for example, apparently tried “to vote for their dead relative.” Overall, however, the rejection rate for signatures this year, 0.15%, was almost identical to the rate in 2018. “Both parties,” Mr. Sterling added, “had the opportunity to view this in real time when it was being done.”
In Wisconsin, where Mr. Trump is down by about 21,000, a narrow recount is underway. There the Trump campaign must foot the bill, and it has put up $3 million for a recount in two blue counties, Milwaukee and Dane. In Arizona, Maricopa County supervisors voted unanimously Friday to certify their election result. “There is no evidence of fraud or misconduct or malfunction in Maricopa County,” the GOP chairman said, “and that is with a big zero.”
Meantime, the Trump campaign disavowed Sidney Powell. At Thursday’s news conference with Rudy Giuliani, Ms. Powell alleged that Dominion voting machines run software created in Venezuela to fix elections. On Newsmax TV in subsequent days, she claimed Mr. Kemp was in on the scheme. Also, Ms. Powell said, the Justice Department and the FBI might be “complicit,” adding that “the CIA, I’m sure, had a hand in it.” On Sunday, the Trump campaign issued a short, unceremonious statement: “Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own. She is not a member of the Trump Legal Team.”
There’s wrangling yet to come, but as states certify and lawsuits get swatted down, Mr. Trump is running out of time and options.

2020/11/23,U.S. Media and Covid ,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-media-and-covid-11606173523,"Recently this column noted the widespread failure of American media to put Covid risks in context, and also the disturbing habit of “fact checkers” to brand accurate Trump vaccine predictions as false. Now researchers from the Ivy League of all places report a striking pessimism among major U.S. media outlets in their coverage of the virus compared to scientific journals and overseas media outlets. 
Readers can only guess why U.S. major media outlets in 2020 would be so much more inclined than others to downplay potential positive news about the fight against the virus. Today’s news coincidentally provides a case study. 
The Journal’s Jenny Strasburg and Joseph Walker report today from London:
The doubters have been highly concentrated in U.S. newsrooms. In a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, authors from Dartmouth and Brown report:
There was an amazing vaccine development story taking place, even if many media folk failed to recognize it. As for the specific vaccine in the news today, the NBER authors review the recent history:
Perhaps Dr. Whitty should consider a career in political polling, where significant forecasting errors are now more or less expected. As for the tendency toward pessimism, the authors of the NBER paper see a “similar disconnect” when it comes to U.S. major media reporting on school reopenings and note:
***
Did a distaste for President Trump lead to errors in covering the Covid story in 2020? If so, the potential problem is not limited to the press corps and its medical reporting. 
A new danger for the U.S. and the world is that the expected new leadership in Washington has too negative a view of Mr. Trump to recognize the value of his achievements.
“ Joe Biden intends to nominate Antony Blinken to serve as secretary of state,” writes the Journal’s Ken Thomas from Washington. Mr. Thomas notes:
No one questions Mr. Blinken’s credentials as an insider, given his substantial Beltway experience. But in at least one very important part of the world Mr. Trump could hardly be more influential and effective in forming alliances, however one defines the game. The Journal’s Felicia Schwartz and Summer Said report from Tel Aviv:
Let’s hope the expected return to power of Washington’s insiders doesn’t spoil the game that is yielding historic results.

2020/11/23,Boeing and Airbus Bicker While China Reaches for the Sky,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-and-airbus-bicker-while-china-reaches-for-the-sky-11606173409,"One of the trade challenges Joe Biden will have to face as president will be how best to manage the U.S. dispute with the European Union over Boeing and Airbus. The fight seems never-ending, but one background detail has made it more urgent: China is preparing to break into the aircraft market and claim a large share from its vulnerable adversaries.
The U.S.-EU dispute escalated earlier this month when Brussels announced new tariffs on $4 billion of U.S. exports, in retaliation for subsidies Washington provides to give Boeing a leg up in the airplane market. The EU’s move follows the restrictions the U.S. imposed last year on $7.5 billion of EU exports, from cheese and pork to olive oil and wine.
Unlike many of the tariffs the Trump administration has imposed over the past four years, these mutually retaliatory tariffs are perfectly legal under international law because they have been authorized by the World Trade Organization.
Two parallel WTO cases have resulted in parallel rulings: The EU has violated WTO subsidy rules by aiding Airbus, and the U.S. in turn has violated those same rules by aiding Boeing. Because WTO jurists have determined that neither side has complied fully with these rulings, each side has been given legal permission to levy new border taxes against the other.
The tariffs have stoked economic pain on both sides of the Atlantic, especially amid the global downturn caused by Covid-19. The failure to resolve this dispute also further complicates the misfortunes of the aviation sector, which is among those that have suffered most during the pandemic. 
The beginnings of the standoff trace to the 1970s, when Airbus (owned jointly by French, Spanish, German and British interests) first began to take significant market share from Boeing, which had previously been a virtual monopoly. The full-blown dispute began in 1992, after the U.S. and the EU agreed to limit the governmental subsidies granted to both.
In 2004, that agreement fell apart because of trans-Atlantic differences over what types of state aid were permitted. The U.S. pulled out of the agreement and filed a WTO case against the EU’s subsidies. In reply, the EU filed a similar WTO case against the U.S. Sixteen years of complex litigation followed. 
The WTO cases concluded this year, but neither side has agreed to talks that might lead to full tariff repeals and an end to Boeing and Airbus threatening each other’s viability. That resolution should occur sooner rather than later. For now, the two companies retain a global duopoly in producing large civilian aircraft, but the market is about to change dramatically. 
China, which soon will become the world’s largest aviation market, has for years sought to become a major aviation manufacturer as a part of its Made in China 2025 plan. One of the 10 key sectors China has targeted in its industrial policy is aerospace and aeronautical equipment. 
Beijing’s hopes—along with untold sums—have been placed in a state-owned enterprise, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac. Until recently, Comac lagged several years behind in its plan for making a large passenger jet to compete with Boeing and Airbus. The two Western giants generally dismissed the likelihood of genuine Chinese competition any time soon.
That calculation changed last month. Comac’s 168-seat narrow-body C919 jet, a potential competitor to Boeing’s 737 MAX and Airbus’s A320neo, performed its first air-show flight, at the Nanchang Flight Convention. Comac is seeking certification for the C919 in 2021, and the first deliveries of the plane are scheduled for that year.
China may continue to trail the U.S. and EU in this sector, which is based in some of the world’s most advanced technology. But China’s progress in fields such as telecommunications and weapons manufacturing suggest that it should not be underestimated in any sector. Declining demand for large civilian aircraft during the pandemic may also give the Chinese an opening to seize a share of a shrunken short-term market by undercutting Boeing and Airbus on price.
Because the U.S. and the EU for decades have been the only global producers of large civilian aircraft, all other WTO members have long been willing to let the two of them cut a separate deal on their aircraft subsidies. But if the two powers don’t resolve their dispute soon, they may have to make room for China at the negotiating table.

2020/11/23,A Heap of Thanksgiving Hypocrisy,Main Street,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-heap-of-thanksgiving-hypocrisy-11606173248,"Californians live under some of the tightest Covid-19 restrictions in the nation. So when Gov. Gavin Newsom was recently caught without a mask at a crowded table for 12 at a posh Napa Valley eatery, he instantly became the poster boy for the “Do as I Say, Not as I Do” crowd. 
He’s hardly the only one. Not long after Mr. Newsom’s visit to the French Laundry was exposed, Californians read about a delegation of their lawmakers who’d jetted to a Maui resort for a conference as everyone else was being told to avoid nonessential travel. New Yorkers earlier learned that Mayor Bill de Blasio was working out at his favorite Park Slope YMCA right as he was shutting down the city. And of course Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot made headlines for sneaking off to get their hair done when barbershops and salons were closed to everyone else.
No doubt Thanksgiving will bring fresh examples. While many citizens dutifully inform grandma there’s no room for her at the table because of new Covid-19 restrictions, someone inevitably will be caught enjoying the holiday with dozens of friends and second cousins who have flown in for some bird and gravy. And we in the press will let our righteous indignation rip.
Yours truly enjoys a good gotcha as much as the next man. And it’s easy to mock these pols for their blatant hypocrisy when they are caught. But maybe the more important lesson to be learned here is that hypocrisy is guaranteed when we impose one-size-fits-all mandates that are rigid and unworkable.
 Daniel Halperin is an adjunct professor at the University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health. He says he understands why people get upset when politicians are caught doing something they are admonishing everyone else not to do. But as he explains in his recent book, “Facing COVID Without Panic,” he believes a bigger part of the problem has been the reliance on mandates, especially those that have only a marginal impact on the virus’s spread.
“Many of these mandates and guidelines fixate on behaviors and settings where the actual risk is very low, such as fleeting public encounters, surface-based transmission or beach visits,” he says in an email. “Meanwhile, measures which could have the greatest prevention impact, such as re-engineering buildings to improve air circulation, are still not widely prioritized—not to mention even simpler actions, such as opening windows to allow outdoor air to circulate indoors.”
Unlike the “science” invoked for some of the more dubious restrictions (e.g., broad lockdowns and school closures), concerns about large Thanksgiving gatherings are legitimate. Certainly the risk of transmission goes up with indoor gatherings that bring together people from multiple households. This is why Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order limiting New Yorkers to 10 people for at-home gatherings.

But manifestly it isn’t working. Police are making clear they can’t and won’t enforce such a ban. At a gym outside Buffalo on Friday, dozens of business owners who had met to discuss how to survive new Covid-19 restrictions chased away a health inspector and two sheriff’s deputies who had gone inside to break up the meeting because it violated the governor’s limit. It’s a good example of how relying on government edicts rather than persuasion breeds contempt for both health experts and the law.
What might have been a more productive path for dealing with Thanksgiving concerns? Certainly Mr. Cuomo could discourage large family celebrations. But he would have done better to underscore where the greatest risks are—i.e., that a Thanksgiving with a half-dozen septuagenarian uncles with diabetes and heart conditions is a far riskier proposition than a turkey dinner shared by young parents and children. And maybe put the emphasis on ways to mitigate risk, such as opening windows or moving such celebrations outside where possible.
Consider another celebrated gotcha. Recently the president of Notre Dame, the Rev. John Jenkins, was raked over the coals by students and faculty after he appeared at a White House ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett without a mask. Later he tested positive for Covid-19. It appeared karma was catching up with him.
Lost is the real Covid-19 story here: Unlike many other university presidents, Father Jenkins kept Notre Dame’s campus open this semester. It wasn’t without outbreaks and setbacks, but the university adapted and succeeded in keeping life as normal as possible. Doesn’t it suggest the better path forward is to lay out the risks and the ways to mitigate them rather than pretend risk can be eliminated with some sweeping decree?
Certainly leaders ought to live by the same rules they impose on everyone else. But as we celebrate this Thanksgiving amid the many examples of double standards, maybe we should take them as less a morality tale than a sign we need workable guidelines that even politicians could obey.

2020/11/23,Orchard of the Dammed,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/orchard-of-the-dammed-11606173289,"November is a peaceful time in the apple orchard. This year’s crop has been harvested and sold; amber-colored leaves float earthbound in the breeze. A flick of the finger nudges still-clinging leaves to the orchard floor—a simple pleasure.
So, we were more than surprised, as we opened the gate to gather the last of the season’s drops, to find a furry ball under an Idared tree, unhurriedly munching on an apple sandwiched between its paws. We chased him away with a clanking garbage can lid and the next day with a tractor. But he kept coming back.
I got on the horn to Rog, who lives a mile south: “Can I put you on beaver alert?”
“My .22 will be ready,” said Rog, a long-retired postmaster with time on his hands. For years Rog, a backwoodsman by instinct, has been our go-to man for beavers—and for woodchucks and chipmunks, until I completed my apprenticeship.
Beavers being a board-certified specialty, a decade or more ago I had called Rog just after Thanksgiving, when beavers, using front paws and snout, had dammed up the stream that feeds into our quarter-acre pond. They had downed a 16-inch-thick weeping willow and a 75-foot-high white birch, whose branches and twigs they packed with mud and grass to secure the dam. It ran 20 feet across and 4 feet high. It took Rog a month of early-morning visits, slogging around in hip boots, to trap the responsible party, which sat in his wife’s freezer until pelt prices rose.
This time, it took only 10 minutes for Rog to drive over and confront the challenge.
“That isn’t a beaver,” he said from a distance. He eyed the critter and put his .22 into action against the intruder, which was lodged lethargically against the orchard fence. Rog ambled closer for a parting shot. Whatever it was, now it wasn’t.
As he carried the unfortunate out of the orchard with his bare hands, two black-tipped white thorns, each about 2 inches long, stuck to Rog’s jacket.
“It’s a porcupine,” said the oil deliveryman, who by chance was topping off our tanks at the time. A porcupine can have as many as 30,000 quills, some with penetrating barbed ends. Contrary to lore, porcupines can’t propel their quills. But they present mighty shields to would-be antagonists.
A few taps on a very smart phone told that porcupines, at up to 35 pounds, were second only to beavers as the largest North American rodent. From a distance, to a novice, their profile and lumbering gait look remarkably the same. Porcupines cause so much property damage that they can be hunted without a license all year long in New York state.
Porcupines and apple orchards are unhappy partners. With razor-sharp teeth and sharp claws, porcupines are arboreal and take the fruit as well as the leaves and the bark, killing the tree in the process. Sometimes they fall out of the trees and impale themselves on their quills.
Without good-byes, Rog plopped the deceased into a plastic bag, and the two drove off together. To his wife, this would be no surprise.

2020/11/23,Biden’s Foreign-Policy Team Takes Shape,Global View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-foreign-policy-team-takes-shape-11606173198,"The news that President-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate Antony Blinken as secretary of state and to appoint Jake Sullivan as national security adviser speaks volumes about the next era in U.S. foreign policy. 
For one thing, it illustrates that the Biden presidency will not be a third term for the Obama foreign-policy team. Mr. Blinken has a decadeslong history with Mr. Biden, and, like Mr. Sullivan, served Vice President Biden as his national security adviser during the Obama years. As a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a hands-on vice president, Mr. Biden comes to the White House with more foreign-policy experience than any post-World War II president besides Dwight Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush. America’s new foreign policy will have Mr. Biden’s fingerprints all over it; the president-elect knows what he wants and is choosing a team he believes can deliver it. 
The second, related point the appointments make is that Joe Biden has turned to what Obama adviser Ben Rhodes famously called “the Blob”—experienced foreign-policy insiders who work comfortably within the key assumptions that have guided U.S. foreign policy since the late 1940s. The members of the new Biden team have worked with many of their peers and counterparts abroad. Mr. Blinken and the likely new defense secretary, Michèle Flournoy, worked together during the Trump years at WestExec Advisors, a corporate consulting firm they helped found whose blue-chip client list and ties to Silicon Valley attracted progressives’ ire. This is not the Squad’s dream team, but the president-elect seems untroubled by that perception. 
That said, nobody should mistake this for a Republican administration. Mr. Biden’s expected nominees may be centrists, but it is the Democratic mainstream in which they swim. They are, for example, multilateralists not out of pragmatism (like, say, James Baker and George H.W. Bush), but out of conviction. They are not fanatics, and can be flexible when they must. But for Team Biden, enhanced international cooperation embodied in rule-driven multilateral institutions is the path, and the only path, to control what many Democrats see as existential menaces to civilization—e.g., nuclear proliferation, great-power wars and climate change. 
As the appointment of former Secretary of State John Kerry as “climate czar” makes clear, it would be a great mistake to underestimate the new team’s commitment to addressing this last item. As they see it, climate change is not only a direct threat to international peace and American well-being; it is an issue that links the administration’s foreign and domestic policies and offers an opportunity to split progressive greens away from more isolationist, anticorporate voices on the Democratic left. Linking a global push for an accelerated transition to a net-zero carbon economy (in the relatively distant future) with a domestic infrastructure program focused on green energy can, the new team believes, energize a coalition behind Biden-style centrism at home and abroad. 

This much of the Biden agenda will be warmly welcomed across Europe. A greener, more multilateral U.S. offers an opportunity to renew the trans-Atlantic alliance that the new team will be quick to embrace. 
American foreign-policy’s focus, however, will continue to shift toward the Indo-Pacific. This is very much a “pivot to Asia” foreign-policy team that’s likely to pursue a more robust policy in the East than the Obama administration did. The new team’s critique of Trump-era China policy was on means more than ends. Poor relations with allies, particularly in Europe, meant Team Trump couldn’t marshal a united front on economic matters with China. In Team Biden’s view, this was a fatal flaw that undercut the Trump administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy. 
Globally, besides Iran, which will hope for a return to some version of the nuclear agreement, Germany and Japan are probably the chief beneficiaries of the coming shift in U.S. policy. Berlin can expect a renewed close partnership with Washington. Haggling over its NATO contribution and trade surplus will be off the front burner as America recommits to the multilateral and green goals dear to German hearts. Tokyo can expect continued close support from the U.S. in the face of the China challenge from a less volatile administration with, again, a less mercantilist trade policy. 
Despite Mr. Blinken’s fluent French and deep knowledge of the country, France may be a loser in the shift. France has long chafed under Germany’s clear preference for trans-Atlantic security cooperation over efforts to make the European Union autonomous in defense. With Donald Trump in the White House, French arguments about American unreliability found receptive ears in Berlin. While a 2024 Trump restoration cannot be ruled out, the French case for European defense cooperation could seem a little less urgent on the far side of the Rhine.
The new U.S. foreign-policy leadership is less a team of rivals than a reunion of friends. Let us wish them the best as they prepare for the challenges of leading the world’s greatest power through a stormy and tumultuous time.

2020/11/23,Notable & Quotable: Georgia,Notable & Quotable,https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-georgia-11606173134,"From “Are Republicans Really Favored in Georgia?” by Sean Trende, Real Clear Politics, Nov. 18:
Part of what fuels media skepticism about Democrats’ chances in these races is the outcome of previous runoff elections, where Democrats have made the postseason in good condition, only to lose in the end. . . . But this might tell us more about the nature of the parties’ old coalitions than anything else. Runoff elections are typically low-turnout events, and when the Democratic coalition in Georgia consisted largely of whites without college degrees and blacks, they were placed at a disadvantage in an election where high-propensity voters dominated. . . . That might not be the case anymore. Republicans may find their turnout efforts hamstrung if whites with college degrees in metro Atlanta turn out in force . . . but instead vote Democratic this time. . . .
On top of this, there is likely still something of a difference between a “Trump voter” and a “Republican voter.” . . . Voters who backed the president because of who he is seem unlikely to turn out in droves for Loeffler and Perdue. In fact, these voters might be disenchanted by the Republican Party’s failure to go all-in on the president’s claims of voter fraud and a stolen election. State election officials, all of whom are Republican, are compelled to admit that there is little evidence of fraud in the state, which runs contrary to the president’s claims.

2020/11/23,Hong Kong Takes Issue With Our Editorial,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-takes-issue-with-our-editorial-11606157349,"Your editorial “Democracy Dies in the Open” (Nov. 12) ignores fundamental facts that lie at the heart of Hong Kong’s relationship with our country and with the rest of the world.
First, the commitment to the principle of “one country, two systems” remains solidly strong. “One country” has its baseline while “two systems” has its boundary. All Legislative Council (LegCo) members have the right to express different political views and to monitor the government. This is their duty. It, however, does not mean that legislators can do whatever they like in exercising their rights. Inviting foreign countries to impose sanctions on our nation and Hong Kong is absolutely unacceptable.
Second, the four legislators mentioned were disqualified because they had already been barred from running for re-election in the Sept. 6 election in accordance with the law, on grounds that they were not genuinely upholding the Basic Law and honoring the pledge of allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR. The election in question had been unavoidably postponed for a year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. While the current-term LegCo continues discharging its duties, it would be illogical and arbitrary if those not qualified to contest the election are allowed to continue to serve as LegCo members.
Third, the HKSAR Government is not targeting any LegCo member. Nor are we going for political suppression, or silencing dissenting views. Many countries require legislators to take an oath of allegiance. Members of the U.S. Congress are required to swear to support and defend the U.S. constitution or face criminal charges. This is an international norm. To suggest otherwise smacks of double standards.

2020/11/23,Judy Shelton and the Hazard of Independent Ideas,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/judy-shelton-and-the-hazard-of-independent-ideas-11606157303,"Regarding your editorial “Judy Shelton’s Heresy” (Nov. 18): Judy Shelton’s failure to secure Senate nomination to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is about much more than not being “a member of the Washington club” or having different monetary opinions about inflation or interest rates. 
Her sin is that her monetary views are centered around a strong dollar (God forbid), which brings into play a currency pegged to the gold standard and the necessity of balanced budgets. This is indeed heresy to the global elite, government leaders in developed nations and their central-bank cohorts who assist them in buying votes, power and wealth.
Contrary to popular opinion in Washington and capitals world-wide, deficits do matter and there is in fact a serious income-inequality problem around the world. History tells us how stories like this end. Judy Shelton deserves appointment to the Board of Governors because crony capitalism is a dangerous game, and if we don’t end it ourselves, then China will do it for us.

2020/11/24,The Transition Begins,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-transition-begins-11606262297,"Things are looking bleak for the Trump legal effort to stop former Vice President Joe Biden from becoming the next president. But whether or not the Trump campaign can demonstrate any problems large enough to change the election results or persuade any judges to intervene, it’s raised questions about the process that voters of both parties may wish to explore.
NBC News reports:
Earlier, John Beauge of the Harrisburg Patriot-News reported on the Trump campaign’s legal effort to prevent the certification. The campaign was seeking to get judges to address the merits of expert testimony, including from a mathematician who reviewed data provided by a former Trump campaign official. According to the Patriot-News report:
Mr. Miller is a co-author of an earlier analysis which disappointed Trump fans by throwing cold water on the idea of significant fraud in Pennsylvania. Now he’s taking pains to emphasize that his new study, which is enraging leftist academics, does not say that Mr. Trump won but simply extrapolates from telephone survey data of GOP voters commissioned by a former Trump campaign official. 
Mr. Miller wrote in his declaration filed in court:
For any Trump voters holding out hope that the results can be overturned, this is of course not the best time to appeal to the authority of a political poll. There’s a question of whether the survey sample was truly representative of the target population. To be meaningful in assessing possible impact on the election outcome, such a survey would also need to include non-GOP voters as well. It’s conceivable Democrats were treated even worse than Republicans. And of course in assessing the impact there’s also the question of how many uncounted voters chose their own party’s candidate. To ensure the integrity of future elections Americans of all political stripes may want to know the answers.
***
Now that the votes have been cast in U.S. elections, news reporters and producers who took a pass on exploring the Biden family influence business have another chance to dig into the issue. According to a recent press release from the office of Iowa’s senior senator, there are new details on the sources of cash to various Biden-related entities:
***
Some readers think this column has been too critical of Dr. Anthony Fauci for his misguided support of lockdowns in response to Covid-19. But such readers will not read any complaints about him here today. The government disease expert is performing a public service in urging politicians like Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D., N.Y.) to refrain from adding new bureaucratic obstacles to the introduction of vaccine reviews.
Marketwatch’s Quentin Fottrell reports:
Mr. Cuomo’s insistence on adding state politics to the process of rolling out Covid vaccines is especially irksome given his previous comments on the matter. At an April 15 press conference, Gov Cuomo predicted that it would be 12-18 months before “we have a vaccine” and also made an interesting offer:
Would New Yorkers have tolerated Mr. Cuomo’s economy-crushing lockdown if they had known he would end up seeking to delay the arrival of a vaccine?

2020/11/24,Democrats Defrock Dianne Feinstein,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-defrock-dianne-feinstein-11606261698,"Raise your hand if you think Senate Democrats have been too accommodating of President Trump’s judicial nominees over the past four years. Well, the party has now muscled Judiciary Committee ranking Member Dianne Feinstein out of her post for insufficient ideological zeal. The defrocking is a clue for Georgia voters about the judicial priorities of Democrats if they win control of the Senate in the Jan. 5 runoffs.
The hits against Senator Feinstein started in September after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Democrats were starting to threaten court-packing if Republicans filled the seat, but Senator Feinstein came out against nuking the legislative filibuster. Soon a Politico story appeared, “Democrats worry Feinstein can’t handle Supreme Court battle,” citing interviews “with more than a dozen Democratic Senators and aides.”
Mrs. Feinstein opposed Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation and joined her colleagues in boycotting the committee vote. Yet progressives were furious that she had hugged her counterpart, Chairman Lindsey Graham, and said a kind word about his handling of the hearings. Activist groups called for her resignation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he “had a long and serious talk with Senator Feinstein” for her transgressions against incivility.
That call to the principal’s office might have led to a mere suspension. But on Monday Senator Feinstein announced: “After serving as the lead Democrat on the Judiciary Committee for four years, I will not seek the chairmanship or ranking member position in the next Congress.” Her statement contained no mention of the crusade against her.
Dick Durbin of Illinois, a more progressive Democrat, announced that he hopes to replace Mrs. Feinstein. “While President Trump assaulted the Constitution,” he said in a statement, “the Judiciary Committee abdicated its oversight responsibilities and became little more than a conveyor belt to rubberstamp ideological and largely unqualified judicial nominees.” As many Democrats see it, Justice Brett Kavanaugh had it too easy.
All of this reinforces the stakes of the Georgia runoff elections, which will decide who leads the Senate and the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Durbin was one of the five Democrats who signed the infamous amicus brief in 2019 threatening that the Supreme Court could be “restructured” if the Justices didn’t vote their way on a gun case. Joe Biden would be pressured to put forward more liberal nominees, and the usual bipartisan courtesies over district-court trial judges would vanish. 
Meanwhile, whatever you do, don’t get caught hugging a Republican. These days it can ruin your political career.

2020/11/24,"The Dow Hits 30,000",Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dow-hits-30-000-11606261738,"The American economy is a wonderful engine of prosperity left to its own devices, and on Tuesday it proved this again with another surge in equity prices that pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 30,000 for the first time. Stock prices rise and fall, but this symbolic milestone of optimism for the future shows the economy’s resilience despite the Covid-19 plague.
We’ve lost track of the many doom and gloom predictions, especially since politicians shut down the economy in March. Remember the disaster that was supposed to follow the end of enhanced federal jobless benefits on July 31? Didn’t happen. Third quarter growth was 33.1%. 
Then recall the catastrophe if Congress didn’t pass another $3 trillion spending bill? Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi issued almost daily press releases, echoed by the sages at Bloomberg. Didn’t happen. Then last week we were told that if the Treasury ended the Federal Reserve’s special pandemic facilities, the markets would reel. Some reeling. 
Instead the economy keeps growing, and the jobless rate keeps falling, despite the surge in new Covid infections. The Atlanta Fed is estimating growth in the fourth quarter, which is halfway over, at 5.6%. That could certainly change if more governors follow California’s Gavin Newsom in punishing his state’s citizens with lockdowns. That’s one reason California’s jobless rate was fifth highest among the 50 states in October at 9.3%. New York was third highest at 9.6%.
Meantime, overall U.S. growth continues to surprise for the better. The housing market is booming, and consumer and small-business confidence are strong. The unemployment rate is down to 6.9%, and continuing jobless claims fell another 429,000 in last week’s report. Americans have enormous savings they can deploy, which explains why consumers keep spending despite the pandemic. Auto sales have been strong, no doubt in part because people are flying less and aren’t taking the usual vacations.
Investors are looking at the medical miracles of Covid vaccines that portend the end of the pandemic in 2021. The fading chance of post-election political trauma helps, but the bigger boost to the market has come from the prospect of a Republican Senate acting as a check on Joe Biden’s destructive tax increases. He can still do damage with regulation, but that takes more time and is subject to legal challenge. The two Georgia runoffs on Jan. 5 producing a Democratic Senate are, apart from shutdowns, the biggest market risk ahead.
By the way, on Election Day in 2016 the Dow closed at 18,332.

2020/11/24,The Desolate Wilderness,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-desolate-wilderness-11606261596,"Here beginneth the chronicle of those memorable circumstances of the year 1620, as recorded by Nathaniel Morton, keeper of the records of Plymouth Colony, based on the account of William Bradford, sometime governor thereof:
So they left that goodly and pleasant city of Leyden, which had been their resting-place for above eleven years, but they knew that they were pilgrims and strangers here below, and looked not much on these things, but lifted up their eyes to Heaven, their dearest country, where God hath prepared for them a city (Heb. XI, 16), and therein quieted their spirits.
When they came to Delfs-Haven they found the ship and all things ready, and such of their friends as could not come with them followed after them, and sundry came from Amsterdam to see them shipt, and to take their leaves of them. One night was spent with little sleep with the most, but with friendly entertainment and Christian discourse, and other real expressions of true Christian love.
The next day they went on board, and their friends with them, where truly doleful was the sight of that sad and mournful parting, to hear what sighs and sobs and prayers did sound amongst them; what tears did gush from every eye, and pithy speeches pierced each other’s heart, that sundry of the Dutch strangers that stood on the Key as spectators could not refrain from tears. But the tide (which stays for no man) calling them away, that were thus loath to depart, their Reverend Pastor, falling down on his knees, and they all with him, with watery cheeks commended them with the most fervent prayers unto the Lord and His blessing; and then with mutual embraces and many tears they took their leaves one of another, which proved to be the last leave to many of them.
Being now passed the vast ocean, and a sea of troubles before them in expectations, they had now no friends to welcome them, no inns to entertain or refresh them, no houses, or much less towns, to repair unto to seek for succour; and for the season it was winter, and they that know the winters of the country know them to be sharp and violent, subject to cruel and fierce storms, dangerous to travel to known places, much more to search unknown coasts.
Besides, what could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness, full of wilde beasts and wilde men? and what multitudes of them there were, they then knew not: for which way soever they turned their eyes (save upward to Heaven) they could have but little solace or content in respect of any outward object; for summer being ended, all things stand in appearance with a weatherbeaten face, and the whole country, full of woods and thickets, represented a wild and savage hew.
If they looked behind them, there was a mighty ocean which they had passed, and was now as a main bar or gulph to separate them from all the civil parts of the world.

2020/11/24,And the Fair Land,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/and-the-fair-land-11606261471,"Any one whose labors take him into the far reaches of the country, as ours lately have done, is bound to mark how the years have made the land grow fruitful.
This is indeed a big country, a rich country, in a way no array of figures can measure and so in a way past belief of those who have not seen it. Even those who journey through its Northeastern complex, into the Southern lands, across the central plains and to its Western slopes can only glimpse a measure of the bounty of America.
And a traveler cannot but be struck on his journey by the thought that this country, one day, can be even greater. America, though many know it not, is one of the great underdeveloped countries of the world; what it reaches for exceeds by far what it has grasped.
So the visitor returns thankful for much of what he has seen, and, in spite of everything, an optimist about what his country might be. Yet the visitor, if he is to make an honest report, must also note the air of unease that hangs everywhere.
For the traveler, as travelers have been always, is as much questioned as questioning. And for all the abundance he sees, he finds the questions put to him ask where men may repair for succor from the troubles that beset them.
His countrymen cannot forget the savage face of war. Too often they have been asked to fight in strange and distant places, for no clear purpose they could see and for no accomplishment they can measure. Their spirits are not quieted by the thought that the good and pleasant bounty that surrounds them can be destroyed in an instant by a single bomb. Yet they find no escape, for their survival and comfort now depend on unpredictable strangers in far-off corners of the globe.
How can they turn from melancholy when at home they see young arrayed against old, black against white, neighbor against neighbor, so that they stand in peril of social discord. Or not despair when they see that the cities and countryside are in need of repair, yet find themselves threatened by scarcities of the resources that sustain their way of life. Or when, in the face of these challenges, they turn for leadership to men in high places—only to find those men as frail as any others.
So sometimes the traveler is asked whence will come their succor. What is to preserve their abundance, or even their civility? How can they pass on to their children a nation as strong and free as the one they inherited from their forefathers? How is their country to endure these cruel storms that beset it from without and from within?
Of course the stranger cannot quiet their spirits. For it is true that everywhere men turn their eyes today much of the world has a truly wild and savage hue. No man, if he be truthful, can say that the specter of war is banished. Nor can he say that when men or communities are put upon their own resources they are sure of solace; nor be sure that men of diverse kinds and diverse views can live peaceably together in a time of troubles.
But we can all remind ourselves that the richness of this country was not born in the resources of the earth, though they be plentiful, but in the men that took its measure. For that reminder is everywhere—in the cities, towns, farms, roads, factories, homes, hospitals, schools that spread everywhere over that wilderness.
We can remind ourselves that for all our social discord we yet remain the longest enduring society of free men governing themselves without benefit of kings or dictators. Being so, we are the marvel and the mystery of the world, for that enduring liberty is no less a blessing than the abundance of the earth.
And we might remind ourselves also, that if those men setting out from Delftshaven had been daunted by the troubles they saw around them, then we could not this autumn be thankful for a fair land.

2020/11/24,Should Biden Cancel College Debt?,Future View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-biden-cancel-college-debt-11606258984,"Editor’s note: This week’s Future View evaluates canceling student debt. Next week we’ll ask, “How should Joe Biden translate his pledge to ‘heal the nation’ into action?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Dec. 1. The best responses will be published that night.

The Band-Aid Solution
I hate calling my loan provider every semester to get more funding. I despise seeing the value of my outstanding debt rise like an elevator, and if it were all to disappear tomorrow, that would be great for me. But the day after U.S. student debt is canceled, it would begin to build up again and keep increasing until the country is back where it started.
The root of the issue is that colleges continue to raise their prices. This makes higher education inaccessible to lower- and middle-income students unless they take on ever-larger loans. If Joe Biden really wants to help, his administration should regulate the cost of higher education, capping it substantially below today’s level. No doubt it would upset college presidents, but does Mr. Biden want a solution or a Band-Aid? The choice is his.
—Blake Grisham, Saint Louis University, finance

Another Covid Stimulus
Think of it as a stimulus package. By forgiving student debt, the government can free up disposable income for more than 40 million Americans. At this difficult economic time, every dollar counts. Hundreds of U.S. companies have already gone bankrupt, and we can presume that more will follow. It doesn’t make sense right now to have a rising generation—of consumers, entrepreneurs and more—saddled with debt payments.
—EJ Volkman, Western Governors University, business administration
Who’s Bailing Out Whom?
The largest proportion of U.S. student debt—59% of it, according to a Brookings Institution analysis—is held by people in the highest and second-highest income quintiles. They incurred debt to gain degrees, often expensive ones such as medicine, dentistry and law. But those degrees have paid off for them. Canceling student debt would require taxpayers who never went to college to share in the burden that students took on voluntarily, and which many are handling just fine.
College loans have caused a crisis, however, for a smaller set of students who took on significant debt but have poor employment prospects. For these students, a better solution may be to hold their colleges accountable. Many schools offer high-priced degrees in unpromising subject areas, leaving their students drowning in debt with few marketable skills to show for it.
—Cameron Walters, University of Saskatchewan, law (J.D.) and M.B.A.
I’m Up for the Challenge
When I think about graduating from college, the $40,000 in debt I will have accrued looms large. I worry about paying it off while earning an entry-level salary. But I don’t believe the Biden administration should bail me out.
Young adults who seek a college education make hard choices about how to pay for it. Canceling our debt would be a relief but also a cop-out. We must learn to persevere. Paying off college loans will teach personal responsibility and hard work. If we get everything handed to us, how will we learn to appreciate what we have and what it took to get there? The next generation of students could well expect their future debt to be canceled, too, and accordingly take on educational expenses beyond their means.
Paying off my student loans will be difficult, but I’m up for it. The challenge will shape me into a better person and a better American.
—Reagan Gensiejewski, Hillsdale College, rhetoric and public address
Return on Investment
High tuition is the premium that we pay for access to the U.S. job market, the best in the world. It is also what allows American schools to retain substantial independence from government bureaucracy and thereby offer the best education in the world, an education worth accruing debt for. To make college a better investment for students, the Biden administration should focus instead on creating good jobs and fostering a strong economy.
—Rafael Arbex-Murut, Virginia Tech, computer science and mathematics
Try Explaining This One
As a third-year law student with loans of my own, I would certainly benefit from debt forgiveness. But I have worries about how such a policy would affect others. What do you tell the college graduates who spent years working hard and saving every extra dollar to pay off their student loans? 
There are also plenty of high-school graduates who looked at the cost of higher education and made the rational decision to avoid loans and go to trade school, join the military or enter the workforce instead. I’m curious how they would feel about the federal government using their tax dollars to pre-emptively bail out college graduates who, on average, will end up making more than they do. Will these taxpayers be helped with their nonstudent debt or reimbursed for their spending? 
Canceling student debt may only exacerbate the problem it seeks to solve. After all, wouldn’t the policy give colleges the green light to raise tuition even further and encourage students to take out even more debt to keep up? Debt forgiveness will benefit many Americans today, but I worry it will also prepare the next crisis tomorrow.
—Cody Belland, Michigan State University, law (J.D.)

2020/11/24,Lost Your Job? You Shouldn’t Have to Lose Your Home,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/lost-your-job-you-shouldnt-have-to-lose-your-home-11606258583,"The pandemic-related economic shutdown has created a crisis for many low- and moderate-income homeowners who are out of work. The loss of a job can take a terrible personal toll on a family. But unemployment is also the primary cause of foreclosure, which has a cascading negative effect on the economy. Foreclosures reduce the value of nearby homes, diminish city and state tax bases, crimp consumer spending, hurt family stability, disrupt otherwise solvent business practices, and increase health costs. 
To ensure that mass unemployment doesn’t lead to mass foreclosures, private industry has developed a simple, effective new product in partnership with the public sector: lender-paid insurance that will seamlessly cover mortgage payments in the event of involuntary unemployment. This will help people stay in their homes while mitigating foreclosure and forbearance, reducing risk in the mortgage financial market and government-sponsored enterprises with an eye toward potential privatization, and adding security to the secondary market. 
The federal government and taxpayers have a huge stake in preventing foreclosures. Of the roughly $670 billion in mortgages originated in the first quarter of this year, $471 billion was backed by the U.S. government. The federal government currently has potential default losses of up to $1.2 trillion for the Federal Housing Administration mortgage program alone, in which it owns 100% of the risk of loss for 8.1 million forward mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income Americans. 
If mortgage-unemployment insurance had been in place before the pandemic hit, tens of billions of dollars in potential losses from foreclosures caused by unemployment could have been avoided. Mortgage-unemployment insurance is both preventive and automatic. It is preventive in that it plans in advance for both normal and “black swan” unemployment scenarios. It is automatic in that it kicks in as soon as an unemployed homeowner becomes eligible for state unemployment benefits. 
More important, the cost of the insurance is borne by the lender or investor, who would be willing to purchase it to reduce the losses associated with defaults and foreclosures. This proposal would be a win for the homeowner, neighborhoods, mortgage companies and even the federal government, since future foreclosure losses associated with the loans that they currently back otherwise would have to be covered by tax revenue.
This isn’t a stimulus measure. The proposal—like any economically sound insurance proposal—can prevent only future losses. It can’t remedy past or current losses caused by the pandemic. But it can eliminate meaningful future risk of foreclosures and business bankruptcies in both normal and extraordinary black-swan periods of unemployment. 
In a worst-case scenario, as we’ve experienced this year, the federal government would provide a backstop for losses that arise when the national unemployment rate rises above 10%, which happens rarely. That’s much less than the 100% risk the government now holds. Private companies can cover the risk effectively when national unemployment is 10% or less.
The insurance product’s technology-driven, patent-pending process meshes seamlessly with Labor Department systems in all 50 states, so when state unemployment benefits are approved, mortgage-unemployment insurance coverage would begin automatically. 
Unemployment is colorblind and nonpartisan. This coverage could eliminate about 90% of future mortgage foreclosures caused by job loss. Leaders should take this opportunity to protect homeowners and their neighborhoods while reducing potential taxpayer liability from foreclosures due to unemployment. There is no better way to protect what is the greatest financial asset for most low- and moderate-income Americans.

2020/11/24,"It’s Thanksgiving, as Luck Would Have It",Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-thanksgiving-as-luck-would-have-it-11606258522,"The person we marry, the job we land, the friends we find, how long we live—whatever happens in our lives, whether good or bad, hinges on something well-known but little understood, namely the force of nature called luck. Nothing has brought this reality home to me more than the coronavirus pandemic, a roll of the dice for us all.
How I met my wife is an example. I happened to rent a certain apartment in Manhattan and happened to befriend a neighbor named Carmine, whose girlfriend, Diane, happened to have a friend named Elvira. Carmine invited me out one night for a double date and, despite initial doubts, I took him up on it. Less than three years later—and more than 41 years ago—Elvira and I married.
Surely we can attribute such fortuitous outcomes to variables besides luck. We may chalk our successes or failures up to hard work, talent, ambition, foresight, careful planning or cause and effect. Success appears meant to be. All the dots connect. Only because A happened could B happen. Maybe luck is an algorithm. Then again, maybe the factors at play are fate, coincidence, destiny, karma, faith or some random flux of the cosmos.
I’m hardly alone in my belief in luck. Decades ago, I caught a TV interview with actor Paul Newman. He was asked how he became a movie star. “Luck,” he answered. Originally I thought him glib, a performer impersonating humility. But years later, I recalled how he actually looked embarrassed admitting to luck as his lodestar. I realized he meant it.
Luck is no fallacy or superstition, much less blind or dumb. But one recent study showed that lucking out may depend on how we behave. Luck also happens to certain people with particular traits. According to British psychologist Richard Wiseman, lucky people are more outgoing and sociable than unlucky ones. They’re more optimistic and better able to see the positive in the negative. They’re more open to having new experiences, talking to new people, and traveling to new places. They smile twice as often and make more eye contact, thus creating more opportunities. Unknown is whether these characteristics promote luck or vice versa. 
This Thanksgiving, amid a world-wide pandemic, we can see as never before how luck looms everywhere. That maskless stranger coughing four feet away could be spraying fatal droplets. Have we ever needed luck more? 
We’re all playing the odds. This year, let’s express our deepest gratitude for catching a few lucky breaks. 
The other day, I encountered yet another bracing reminder that serendipity can make all the difference. I lifted my foot at a curb to cross a street at a red light where I had right of way. Suddenly a teenager on an electric scooter shot past within a foot of me going at least 25 miles an hour. Had I stepped off the sidewalk, he would have leveled me, causing who knows what injuries or worse. Instead, I hesitated and the incident wound up as merely a close call.
Lucky me. At least for now.

2020/11/24,Media Hysteria Is the Trump Show,Business World,https://www.wsj.com/articles/media-hysteria-is-the-trump-show-11606258495,"It’s worth considering the dollar value of the media time Donald Trump is commanding for his “I wuz robbed” election-cheating show. In 2016, professional Republicans knew their fate was being allied to a performer who cared nothing for the institutional interests or philosophical penchants of the Republican Party. They are being reminded so again. For their part, the media give hysterical treatment to lawsuits and complaints lofted solely to extort hysterical media coverage. When, in his 50 years or public life, has Mr. Trump ever won one of the zillion or so lawsuits he’s filed? But this is the bargain Mr. Trump and the media struck.
It was Democrats, with their efforts to delegitimize his 2016 election, who welded him to the GOP base, especially social conservatives with no natural affinity. Try finding a Democrat now who admits the Russia collusion scam ever took place or remembers that Hillary Clinton just weeks ago advised Joe Biden not to concede if he lost. 
On its best days democracy is a faith machine. It’s bound to be tested by an outcome decided not by a clear preponderance of public sentiment but by the technical accuracy of our vote validating and counting. But every election must end. Our canvassing and recounts will find some errors and uncounted or overcounted votes. We may secretly consider ourselves lucky that it’s impossible to go back and revalidate millions of mail-in ballots. It would take months and the election would remain up in the air. Even so, when economists and statisticians and other analysts have had their say, here’s betting there will be heartburn to go around, including in the new Biden administration.
Meanwhile, the media fibs slightly when it accuses Mr. Trump of trying to “overturn the election.” There is no official result to overturn at least until the states certify. His effort may be hopeless and campy but it fulfills a script his supporters expect. Per the same script, the press now accuses him of seeking to invalidate specifically black votes. In reality, he’s focusing on a handful of urban districts for the same reason Al Gore did in 2000—because monolithic precincts in swing states are the easiest way to add or subtract the requisite number of votes to change a result.
Mr. Gore, of course, only had to remedy a gap of 537 and faced realistic odds. Mr. Trump is playing out a losing hand to extend his dominance of the media and give viewers a season finale. His team has learned from the Steele dossier: Float enough unsubstantiated claims to create an uncertainty about whether there might not be a true one somewhere in the pile.

For four years, Mr. Trump has ably served as both parody of and challenge to the corruption and hypocrisy of our leadership class, which continues to resonate. Will conspiracy theories bob in the election’s wake? They always do. You might actually prefer a QAnon-style conspiracy theory, which millions enjoy without believing, to an Obama birth certificate-style theory, which is dangerously susceptible to resolution.
But always and everywhere an appetite exists for stories about the extravagant iniquity of our opponents. Mrs. Clinton and Adam Schiff continue to invoke the Russia narrative at every opportunity, to slur inconvenient Democrats or create a smokescreen around Hunter Biden. Or take the Miami Herald—still dining out on a conspiracy theory it invented about the federal prosecution of the pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, which has been debunked by both the Washington Post and the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility.
Our media has a hard time reporting comfortably on things that are serious and not serious at the same time. They still can’t get their minds around the fact that many Trump supporters laugh off much of what he says. 
And yet, for all the hysteria, this month’s election testifies to the steadiness of our institutions. Our democracy did what a democracy should, steering us away from the rocks. Mr. Trump was ousted for all the flaws even many of his supporters disapprove of, and yet the election was hardly a repudiation of his policies or coalition. Joe Biden was rewarded for not being Trump; Democrats were punished for going off the ideological deep end. The most unappetizing outcomes seem to have been avoided (pending the Georgia Senate races): a newly Democratic Congress impeaching a re-elected Mr. Trump or forcing President Biden into legislative acts grossly unpopular with the American people.
U.S. democracy is a faith machine that continues to reward your faith. Allow yourself to relax a bit and enjoy the latest chapter of the Trump show, which will continue to enrich us with ironies and absurdities and insights to light our way in coming decades as we decode the wild and wonderful experiment known as America.

2020/11/24,The Political Class’s Hypocrisy Long Predates Covid-19,Upward Mobility,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-political-classs-hypocrisy-long-predates-covid-19-11606258191,"While waiting toward the back of a long and slow-moving security line at Reagan National Airport some years ago, I noticed a congressman and his young aide standing a few passengers ahead of me. I was impressed that this relatively well-known lawmaker was waiting patiently with everyone else instead of pulling rank. Then, of course, he pulled rank.
The congressman whispered to his companion, and the two men proceeded to the front of the queue, where they flashed their badges and were escorted through security ahead of the rest of us.
On some level, politicians have always believed that they deserve special treatment, that the ordinary rules don’t apply to them. They have pushed for limits on school choice for the poor while sending their own children to private schools. They have advocated for gun control and defunding the police while being protected by armed security guards. They have denounced the influence of money in politics while courting wealthy donors at closed-door fundraisers.

But the coronavirus protocol breaches we’ve witnessed this year could wind up being far more consequential if they lead to less support for nanny-state policies. Conservatives, who are more constitutionally averse to busybody politicians making decisions for people, were always warier of lockdowns and the rationale behind them. What has changed since the spring is growing skepticism of public-health edicts among liberals.
People in reliably blue states (California, New York, Oregon) as well as in the states that made Donald Trump a one-term president (Wisconsin, Michigan)—have been standing in line for three and four hours to get a Covid-19 test before traveling this week. These people are perfectly aware that infection rates are rising and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly cautions against celebrating the holiday with people outside your household. Alas, many of them don’t seem to care anymore. According to the American Automobile Association, there could be as many as 50 million Thanksgiving travelers this year, only 10% less than in 2019.
This is a form of mass civil disobedience like nothing the country has seen since the 1960s. Some of it is born of Covid fatigue, to be sure. But the endless parade of politicians flouting their own rules surely has also played a role. It began shortly after the spring lockdowns and if anything has become more commonplace, even farcical.
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi violated lockdown orders to get their hair done, which sounds like something a Kardashian would do. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney sneaked out of state to dine at a restaurant in neighboring Maryland because eateries back home were closed to indoor customers. When Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and members of her staff traveled to Delaware to celebrate Joe Biden’s presidential victory, they violated Covid quarantine requirements. And Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who tweeted in July that “wearing masks in public should be mandatory,” has been spotted several times in public not wearing a mask while she was indoors and chatting face to face with others.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom was caught dining indoors with lobbyists at a restaurant in violation of his own pandemic rules for the state. And in New York, which has recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other state, public outrage finally forced Gov. Andrew Cuomo to disinvite his 89-year-old mother and two adult daughters from Thanksgiving dinner in Albany.
What’s going on is not simply hypocrisy but an infantilization of the American public. There’s a widespread assumption among liberal elites that the rest of us are incapable of calculating risks and taking necessary precautions to ride out the pandemic, and it’s insulting. Messrs. Newsom and Cuomo and Mrs. Pelosi may take the virus seriously, but they’ve weighed the odds of becoming infected and acted accordingly. They figure they probably won’t get it, and even if they do, they’ll be fine after a few days. They know that most people don’t become seriously ill and that the already high survival rate has been climbing as we’ve learned more about treating the virus.
The decision of so many millions of Americans to buck public-health warnings, trust their common sense, and spend Thanksgiving with loved ones is a welcome indication that people may be tiring of all this condescension. How the political class responds is another matter. These are the same politicians who had no shame about gathering at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta in July to eulogize the late Rep. John Lewis even while millions of grieving Americans were barred from giving their own loved ones proper funerals. Then again, I doubt the congressman would have minded the special treatment any more than he did when he cut the line at Reagan National Airport.

2020/11/24,Notable & Quotable: Dianne Feinstein,Notable & Quotable,https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-dianne-feinstein-11606258148," Marianne Levine and Burgess Everett reporting for Politico, Nov. 23:
Sen. Dianne Feinstein plans to step down as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. . . . “After serving as the lead Democrat on the Judiciary Committee for four years, I will not seek the chairmanship or ranking member position in the next Congress,” the California Democrat said. . . . Feinstein added that she planned to focus her attention on combating climate change and the coronavirus pandemic.
Members of her own party had expressed concern before Barrett’s hearing that the 87-year-old wouldn’t be aggressive enough. Her approach . . . confirmed many Democrats’ fears, particularly after she praised Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) for his handling of the process and gave him a hug at the conclusion.
Shortly after the hearings, several liberal groups called on her to resign from her position. One of those groups, Demand Justice, applauded her decision to step down.
“This was a necessary step if Democrats are ever going to meaningfully confront the damage Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have done to the federal judiciary,” said Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice. “Going forward, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee must be led by someone who will not wishfully cling to a bygone era of civility and decorum that Republicans abandoned long ago.”

2020/11/24,Azerbaijan Respects All Cultural Monuments,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/azerbaijan-respects-all-cultural-monuments-11606246519,"Regarding Christina Maranci’s “Cultural Heritage in the Crosshairs Once More” (Arts & Review, Nov. 19): As a multicultural and multireligious country, Azerbaijan has always been home to representatives of all nations and religions, who have coexisted and worked together peacefully for centuries. Azerbaijan’s Christian community is a vital and active part of our society whose monuments and places of worship in our country are protected and regularly restored by the Azerbaijani state. It is no coincidence that Pope Francis praised religious tolerance in Azerbaijan as a model for the world in 2016 during his visit to Baku.
Since the outset of the conflict, Armenia repeatedly attempted to blame damage to churches and other historically sensitive landmarks on Azerbaijan. This has been offered without substantive proof nor has it been confirmed by any independent international organization. So it is clear for the record: Azerbaijani forces do not target historic, cultural and, especially, religious buildings and monuments. To the contrary, Azerbaijan has contributed to the protection of Christian landmarks not only within the country but also world-wide.
As was witnessed by the world, following the signing of the peace agreement, Armenians destroyed monuments, houses, forests and critical infrastructure like hospitals and schools. This destruction advances no cause and only serves to destroy history, inflict long-term damage and make recovery slower.
As Franklin D. Roosevelt said, “I have seen war . . . I hate war.” Azerbaijan is committed to a peaceful transition and rebuilding that protects our citizens and religious landmarks. It is our sincere hope that Armenia will respect the peace agreement and prevent further destruction and tragic loss of life.

2020/11/24,We Didn’t Intimidate Guantánamo Lawyers,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/we-didnt-intimidate-guantanamo-lawyers-11606246473,"In “In Defense of Unpopular Clients—and Liberty” (op-ed, Nov. 19), Michel Paradis and Wells Dixon laudably criticize the despicable campaign by the Lincoln Project and others to shame law firms representing President Trump and force them to withdraw from representing the president. Regrettably, their efforts bore fruit. Yet our legal system requires attorneys to represent all clients, especially unpopular ones. 
Unfortunately, the authors erroneously claimed that there was a “campaign by the George W. Bush administration to pressure corporations to drop law firms” that represented Guantánamo detainees, and that I was “forced to resign as deputy assistant defense secretary for detainee affairs” for pressing “talking points against detainee lawyers.” 
First, far from being forced to resign, I was asked to stay on by the deputy secretary of defense, but chose to step down at the time of my choice, having accomplished the tasks I had set out to do when I was appointed to that position. Second, there were not “talking points” and no “campaign” by the Bush administration against Guantánamo detainees’ lawyers. Rather, there was one ineptly phrased 2006 radio interview by me, for which I immediately apologized. That’s why I signed onto a 2010 open letter, spearheaded by Brookings Institution scholar Ben Wittes, which criticized Liz Cheney’s group, Keep America Safe, for attacking Obama Justice Department attorneys, who previously represented Guantánamo detainees. I also gave interviews saying that such tactics were “below the belt.” To be clear, I share the views expressed by the authors of “In Defense of Unpopular Clients,” and have made that clear for over a decade.

2020/11/24,Cuomo: Enforce Only the Laws I Agree With,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/cuomo-enforce-only-the-laws-i-agree-with-11606246431,"Regarding New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Nov. 18 press conference (Notable & Quotable, Nov. 20): You highlight Gov. Cuomo’s back and forth with reporters over his plan to limit personal gatherings to no more than 10 people during Thanksgiving. The governor goes to great lengths highlighting the responsibility of (all) authorities to support and uphold the law without consideration of personal bias or prejudice. Perhaps Gov. Cuomo doesn’t think federal law is really law. Otherwise, why would he and the rest of Democratic-controlled New York have adopted positions that fly in the face of the federal immigration laws and regulations? New York’s “Green Light” law, passed last year, grants illegal immigrants the right to a New York driver’s license, and New York City proudly declares itself a sanctuary city. Federal agencies are also prohibited from accessing the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles automated files. Imagine a border agent missing a potential terrorist threat because he or she couldn’t see a DMV record on a New York vehicle entering the U.S. from Canada simply because it had New York plates. Once again, Gov. Cuomo has shown himself to be a bully to those who ask legitimate questions he doesn’t like, and a hypocrite of the grandest proportions.

2020/11/24,H.R. 1 Will Make America More Democratic,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/h-r-1-will-make-america-more-democratic-11606246387,"Kimberley Strassel’s “Harvesting the 2020 Election” (Potomac Watch, Nov. 13) criticizing the democracy reform bill, the For the People Act (H.R. 1), demonstrates the partisan nature of attacking any effort to improve our election systems. These critiques overlook how H.R. 1 would be beneficial for all Americans, and is integral to strengthening the foundational values of our democracy. 
The main objective of this bill is to make our politics less partisan, and more representative of every American. A true democracy, for example, doesn’t let elected officials of any party pick their voters through gerrymandering like our current system allows. H.R. 1 will change the game by reforming the flaws in our system to ensure that our government responds to, reflects and represents us. 
Ms. Strassel also claims the legislation would establish “new rules designed to water down ballot integrity.” H.R. 1 does just the opposite. It would ensure the protection of ballot integrity by prohibiting voter roll purges like those seen in Ohio and Georgia and expanding opportunities for mail-in voting—an effective and safe way to vote. We’ve already seen Washington’s Republican Secretary of State Kim Wyman become a vocal proponent of mail-in voting, and Utah, a heavily red state, has been an all mail-in voting state since 2012. 
It is time to put aside partisan politics, and face the reality that our democracy is in dire need of repair. Both parties should prioritize the will of the American people who are eager to build a stronger and healthier democracy for all.

2020/11/25,Hindu Nationalists’ Crazy Crackdown on ‘Love Jihad’,East is East,https://www.wsj.com/articles/hindu-nationalists-crazy-crackdown-on-love-jihad-11606349657,"The pandemic is raging in India, economic growth is cratering, and Chinese troops are squatting on land India also claims—and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has odd priorities. It is determined to fight “Love Jihad,” embracing a conspiracy theory that views Muslim men marrying Hindu women as an act of religious warfare.
Talk of Love Jihad once was limited to the fringes of public discourse. India’s constitution safeguards individual rights, and heterosexual adults may marry whomever they please. But now five BJP-ruled states—Assam, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh—are planning laws against what Haryana’s Home Minister Anil Vij calls “a conspiracy of changing religion by trapping someone in love.” Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has promised that “jihad will not be permitted in the name of love at any cost.” His Karnataka counterpart, B. S. Yediyurappa, says his government takes seriously “the luring of young girls with the use of money or love.”

Last month, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath told “those who conceal their identity and play with the honor of our sisters and daughters” to “mend your ways” or face consequences that he described using a Hindi phrase that alludes to a funeral procession. On Tuesday, the Uttar Pradesh government approved a draft law that punishes with fines and prison sentences “unlawful religious conversion,” including for the purpose of marriage. A convert who plans to marry someone from a different religious background will need to get permission from a bureaucrat two months in advance.
India remains a largely conservative society where most people don’t marry outside their subcaste, let alone outside their faith. Nonetheless, Hindu nationalists have given the lurid conspiracy theory credence in the public’s eyes by promoting it on social media, WhatsApp groups and sympathetic TV channels.
The allegations, often made by obscure Hindu nationalist activists on social media or by local religious figures, might accuse Muslim clerics of training good-looking young men to seduce gullible Hindu women. Sometimes the conspiracy claims that cunning Muslims achieve the same goal by pretending to be Hindus. Either way, the alleged end result is invariably the same: An innocent Hindu damsel is used as a baby-making factory before being cruelly divorced. For good measure, some versions of the conspiracy toss in the Islamic State and bomb-making plots. 
On one level, the progress of this Hindu nationalist equivalent of QAnon—think of it as Cow-Anon—into law and mainstream discourse represents the latest attempt to bully and browbeat India’s 200 million Muslims. The new laws will likely have the same effect as the strengthening of anti-cow-slaughter legislation by BJP state governments in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first term. They will subject interfaith couples to harassment by officials, and give a tacit green light to vigilantes.
But the Love Jihad bogey also reflects a deeper shift under way as emboldened Hindu nationalists turn on classical liberal ideas borrowed from the West. India’s penal code, which is partly based on English common law, was written by the great 19th-century British scholar-politician Thomas Macaulay. The cohort of educated Indian elites who wrote the constitution—adopted in 1950—borrowed heavily from British Indian precedents as well as from Ireland, Australia and the U.S. Bhimrao Ambedkar, the main architect of India’s constitution, held doctorates from Columbia and the London School of Economics.
It’s unclear if Hindu nationalists can operate within constitutional guardrails. The debate over Love Jihad raises important questions: Can Hindu nationalism adapt to universal democratic principles? Or will it evolve as an Indic version of Islamism, another collectivist ideology that extols comforting tales of past glory, actively discriminates against religious minorities, regards unmarried women as communal property, and privileges group solidarity above individual rights?
These questions won’t be settled immediately or cleanly. The new laws will likely not ban Hindu women from embracing their Muslim husbands’ faith. And for now Hindu nationalists lack the ability to junk a more than 150-year-old penal code and a 70-year-old constitution. But the direction India is headed appears clear: Individual rights and minority rights are receding.
Muslims are the current target of choice, but over time the state’s boot will likely also fall on Christians. Several Indian states already boast misnamed “freedom of religion” laws designed to thwart conversion out of Hinduism.
None of this is to deny that Islamism is a real threat to India and the world. The enslavement of Yazidi women by the Islamic State, and kidnappings and forced marriages of Hindu and Christian girls by Muslim landlords in Pakistan, have added to a general sense of unease among some Indians. Conspiracy theorists skillfully weave fact with fiction. 
But you can’t win a battle of ideas with crazy ones. The best weapon against Islamism is not demonization but a sense of fairness that distinguishes between extremists and ordinary Muslims. Love Jihad laws do not represent a nation coming to grips with a problem. They represent a nation losing the plot.

2020/11/25,Blessings in a Hard Year,Declarations,https://www.wsj.com/articles/blessings-in-a-hard-year-11606349509,"It’s been a fairly gruesome year—pandemic, lockdowns, economic woe, death and illness. We’ve done a column in past years asking friends and acquaintances what they’re thankful for. This year we emailed a dozen people whom we respect and who know a lot, asking what they’d seen, experienced or realized this annus horribilis that left them moved or grateful. It could be personal or galactic in scope, concrete or abstract, but not political, and it had to be particular to this year. 
An investor who feared he wouldn’t see much of his grown kids since they’d flown the coop is awed to be living with them in crowded, happy circumstances. A priest is grateful young people are still coming into the church. A former pollster can’t believe how Zoom kept her far-flung family together.

There was a lot of surprised gratitude for technology. A subtext emerged, unexpected gifts of the pandemic. Most of all and strikingly there was deep gratitude for the people who work on the ground in America, who kept the country functioning. Almost everyone mentioned personal thanks for grocery-store workers and truckers. For eight months we’ve read and heard stories of self-sacrifice and dedication. They have sunk in. I believe the pandemic inched forward a certain cultural shift, a broadened sense of who deserves honor. 
 Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, found himself awed this year by “the resilience of the human spirit”—medical professionals “risking their lives to save others, researchers racing against time for a vaccine, and countless everyday heroes delivering packages, stocking shelves.” Technology helped save the day: “When it was crucial to remain apart, technology brought us closer together in ways unimaginable just a few years ago—helping families stay connected . . . helping us all stay productive, entertained, and healthy.”
In some new way the pandemic helped reveal America to itself. Megan McArdle of the Washington Post, who helped nurse her father through his recovery from Covid: “This year I discovered how courageous people can be in the face of adversity, even grave personal danger. Our institutions may have failed us and our civic trust been savagely corroded, but everywhere you turned there were countless individuals bravely doing what they could for their neighbors. Those fine old words from William Hazlitt finally became a visceral reality for me: ‘I do not love war, but I love the courage with which men face war.’ America, I hate this pandemic but I adore your bravery, and am grateful to you for showing it to me.”
 Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said, “I’m grateful for people like Recto. Recto is a home health care worker who, before Covid, took a bus every day to care for two elderly people. When COVID hit New York City his bus route was cancelled, so he took money out of his own pocket to pay for a cab to and from, helping these people who depended on his care.”
Early in the pandemic this column asked political figures to note who was getting us through it, and to take action to help those here illegally. If you can show through pay stub or attesting letter that you worked during the pandemic of 2020, you are thereby granted full citizenship with no fines, fees or penalties. We asked a note be stapled on top: “With thanks from your grateful countrymen.” Mo Rocca of “CBS News Sunday Morning,” who is especially grateful to delivery people, had a better idea. A new immigration policy “damn well better include automatic citizenship,” for those who worked the pandemic but it should come with “a gift bag. Like a super blingy Oscar gift bag.” 
 Father Roger Landry, a Massachusetts priest working at the United Nations, spoke of the courage of police officers, doormen, waiters and chaplains. “Courage is not the absence of fear but doing what one should despite one’s fears. I’m grateful for those who boldly carried on while others cowered.” For some, the pandemic was a spiritual catalyst: “In the midst of widespread spiritual lockdown the hunger of so many for God was stoked.” People “started asking deeper questions about life, death and suffering, how to be selfless, to grieve with hope.” He has this year accompanied “several newly restless hearts to find the God for whom their hearts were made.”
Here are some gifts of the pandemic: 
Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wound up knowing those he knows more deeply. “I watched the extraordinary generosity of friends and neighbors who helped people in desperate financial and spiritual despair because of the pandemic. It reminded me that Americans continue to be the most generous people in the world—not only financially but emotionally.” 
 Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska: “My 97 year old mom entered assisted living on Dec 30, 2019. The Senate’s April recess due to Covid gave me time to begin sorting through more than 60 years of memories in my childhood home.” She did office work online and by phone. “My parents kept everything—WW II letters, family photos, vacation scrapbooks. Toys and blue ribbons. It was a gift.” She’d show her mother what she’d found, and her mother would marvel. “I found the top of their wedding cake—a soldier in uniform standing next to his bride.” It was on a basement shelf. It’s made of ceramic or clay. Fischer now keeps it under a little glass dome. She found the letters her father wrote during the war: “ ‘My darling’ was his salutation.” She found her mother’s sewing box. 
For Jason Gay, the Journal’s sports columnist, the lockdown carried unexpected opportunity. “This was a year of family fishing. I’d resisted it all my life—my late father loved to fish, and I couldn’t be bothered. But now my seven year old son is crazy for it, and my father is up there somewhere laughing. I grew to love the chase, and the disconnect of the natural world. Fish don’t know it’s 2020. I don’t even think fish watch cable news.”
For Willie Geist of NBC News, a fruitful, poignant conversation. “In late September, I was walking the halls of the eerily empty 30 Rockefeller Center when I ran into Herman Pinckney, a beloved custodian in the building. I was surprised when Herman told me he would retire in a couple of days, without fanfare, after 48 years on the job. As he reminisced through a mask, Herman said of the country, ‘I’ve seen a lot. We’re gonna be OK.’ I felt better immediately.”
For me this holiday weekend is quieter than usual, a traditional, raucous house party pushed back. It’s reminded all of us how we cherished our old lives of bubbling affection, and how grateful we’ll be when they return.
For now life wants to increase itself. Our trusty editor of 20 years, James Taranto, wed Anastasia, “the love of my life,” on the Fourth of July. The journalists Betsy Woodruff Swan and her husband, Jonathan, became parents of a baby girl. “At a time when it feels like death is everywhere,” she wrote, “we are incredibly grateful for the gift of a new life.” 
Welcome to the world, Miss Esther Swan, a place that is more tender and beautiful than it always appears.

2020/11/25,A Progressive Assault on Selective High Schools,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-progressive-assault-on-selective-high-schools-11606349353,"Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has fired the latest salvo in America’s assault on meritocracy: a 61-page opinion holding that the suburban Loudoun County school system discriminated against black and Hispanic youngsters because its selective-admission high school, the Academies of Loudon, hadn’t admitted enough of them. Never mind that—as Mr. Herring acknowledged—the school’s test-based admissions process is open to all and fairly managed. Because its results have a “disparate impact,” the school system must scrap it.
Nationwide, selective-admission public schools, also known as “exam schools,” are under attack because the demographics of their student populations don’t match those of their communities. Much like elite universities, critics allege, these schools have been admitting far too many whites and Asians and not nearly enough blacks and Latinos.
The ruckus began in New York, where admission to nine of the city’s hundreds of high schools is governed by the eighth-grader’ scores on a specialized admission test. Topping the list are Stuyvesant and Bronx Science, and there’s no denying that they’re full of Asian and white kids, many from low-income and middle-class families. This has raised hackles for decades, but Mayor Bill de Blasio and his schools chancellor have recently pushed to make the admissions process more “equitable.” They want to reserve places for black and Latino children, abolish the entry exam, and instead admit top students from every middle school in the city.
But is every middle school churning out eighth-graders with the requisite skills and knowledge to succeed at Bronx Science? Are all children who make good grades eager, motivated learners ready to make the most of what these high-powered schools have to offer?
Instead of repairing the elementary and middle schools attended by poor and minority kids so that more of them will be prepared for places like Stuyvesant, and creating more such schools for bright children from every background to get a top-notch education, New York’s equity seekers are pressing to reallocate an extremely scarce resource. Mr. de Blasio and colleagues overlook the educational tragedies that the city’s schools routinely inflict on so many of the girls and boys they claim to be looking after.
The impulse is spreading. Consider another furor in Virginia, over admission to the esteemed Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, regularly ranked the country’s top high school by U.S. News. Thomas Jefferson is in such demand that it can accept fewer than 1 in 6 applicants. It’s been using its own special exam and a “holistic” admissions process that considers essays, interviews and teacher recommendations as well as grades and test scores. Thomas Jefferson’s minders have tried various strategies to bring in more pupils of color but none has worked very well. Among the 486 students in the most recently admitted class, fewer than 25 were black or Hispanic—and few were low-income.
The Fairfax County superintendent and board last month moved to abolish the qualification exam and application fee. The superintendent proposed moving to a lottery system that would place every eighth-grader with good grades into the admissions pool. For now the Fairfax County School Board has shunned the lottery. An Asian-American father, testifying before the board called that plan “government-sponsored discrimination against Asians.” 
Lotteries signal a sort of superficial fairness, but in practice they’re worse than taking every middle school’s best students. Their effect will be to encourage grade inflation across the system—to get more kids into the “pool”—and favor students who may be ill-prepared or indifferent over hundreds who yearn for the opportunity, many of them Asian-Americans from low- or middle-income families bent on getting their children the best possible education. 
Much the same thing is happening elsewhere, including Boston (Boston Latin School), Philadelphia (Central High School), San Francisco (Lowell High School) and Washington (Duke Ellington School of the Arts, School Without Walls and others). All have a small number of highly regarded exam schools with enrollments that don’t mirror their communities and are therefore deemed retrograde, if not discriminatory.
Yet the remedies being sought in every case are wrongheaded. They fiddle with the rationing system instead of adding to the supply of selective schools—fewer than 170 nationwide at last count, among more than 20,000 U.S. high schools—or ensuring that more poor and minority kids are prepared to compete for entry.
Achievement gaps are widespread across America among kids from different backgrounds. On the National Assessment of Educational Progress, 13% of white eighth-grade students reached the “advanced” level in math last year, as did 31% of Asian kids, compared with only 2% and 4% of black and Hispanic children. Students who aren’t doing advanced math by the end of middle school aren’t likely to succeed in selective-entry high schools. But tackling that problem by abolishing tests and randomizing admission forfeits excellence in favor of fake equity.
Developing talented students is the right approach, but that means starting “gifted and talented” programs in many more elementary and middle schools. School systems would also have to face the reality that some kids are smarter and more motivated than others, no matter their color. That’s anathema to “progressive” reformers, who prefer to abolish accelerated classes for high achievers. Ithaca, N.Y., is one of several communities that has moved to make all sixth- and seventh-graders take the same math, no matter how adept some are.
It is the job of schools to create opportunities for all young people, regardless of background, to make the most of themselves. Teachers can encourage the kid with a gleam in her eye to take harder classes. They can spot the shy 8-year-old from a troubled home who loves to read and hustle him into a program for gifted students. They can’t overcome every innate difference or compensate for every disadvantage at home. But the best of today’s charter schools, such as New York’s Success Academy, show that a lot can be overcome.
The progressive assault on education in the name of equity ends up denying smart kids from every background the kind of education that will assist them to make the most of their abilities. That denies America human capital for a robust economy, while keeping a fraught society from producing the opportunities that allow true equity to flourish.

2020/11/25,Covid Lockdown at the North Pole,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-lockdown-at-the-north-pole-11606349305,"I can see him now, sitting by himself in the cramped but clean breakfast buffet area of a roadside hotel near the Fox River in eastern Wisconsin. Baggy red trousers with suspenders, full white beard, big belly, he would sometimes read the morning paper, sometimes glance at the television set bolted to the wall above the miniboxes of cereal.
He seldom spoke, not that the place was busy in the days leading up to Christmas. This was more than 20 years ago; I was covering a court case in rural Wisconsin, and this was the closest place to the courthouse I could find to spend the week. There were some construction workers staying there, and me, and Santa Claus.
I’m thinking about him today because of the decision by Macy’s that, for the first time in 159 years, its department stores won’t have a Santa on site for children and their families to visit. Covid, of course—that’s the reason, and we should have seen the new policy coming. 
Across the country, department stores and malls have agonized about what to do with Santa. Some are offering online visits and Zoom calls, some are putting Santa behind plexiglass or inside a see-through globe. There’s a built-in chilliness: Social distancing and Santa Claus are concepts that clash.
That fellow in Wisconsin always dined silently, but one morning, before I departed for the courthouse, we were both taking the remnants of our breakfasts to the trash and I asked him how long he was staying at the hotel.
“Forty nights,” he said, smiling, and that is when he told me his story.
He was 60, he lived in a small town in Montana, and each year he found work, though an agency, at a mall or store somewhere in the U.S. that needed a full-time Santa. The definition of seasonal labor. That particular year he was assigned to the Fox River Mall, near the hotel. Ten in the morning until the mall closed each night, no days off.
He was a little lonely, he said—he missed his own grandchildren—but what he saw and heard each day was a gift beyond monetary value. The mothers and fathers of the surrounding communities would arrive, and their children would shyly approach and whisper their Christmas wishes to him. “I see amazement in the faces of the children,” he said, “and hope, and excitement.” Greeting all those boys and girls for 40 days, he said, meant he knew that by the time he returned to Montana he would have made thousands of children happy. 
Covid has robbed us all of a lot, and you can’t blame Macy’s and the other stores for being cautious. But the days of pure wonder in a young child’s eyes are finite and nonrenewable. “It fills me with cheer every day,” the Santa at the breakfast buffet told me before heading off to work, in a Christmas season that suddenly feels very far away.

2020/11/25,GM Drives in Political Reverse,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-drives-in-political-reverse-11606348737,"CEOs are offering alms to win favor with their future federal regulators. This week’s aim-to-please prize goes to CEO Mary Barra, who pulled the plug on GM’s support for the Trump Administration in its legal challenge to California’s electric car mandate. 
The Trump Environmental Protection Agency last year revoked the Obama Administration’s Clean Air Act waiver that allowed California to set its own auto greenhouse gas emission standards. Car makers complained that California’s electric-vehicle mandate and stringent emissions rules balkanized the national car market.
If auto makers had to sell more EVs in California—which most currently do at a loss—they’d have to raise prices on gas-fueled cars they sell in other states to compensate. Federal law explicitly prohibits states from setting their own fuel economy standards, and the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. 
Republican states along with GM, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler intervened in support of the Trump Administration in its legal standoff with California. A Biden Administration is expected to reverse the Trump fuel-economy rules and reissue California’s waiver, but both will require new regulations that take time. This means a legal challenge to California's authority to set its own rules may not be moot if auto makers and GOP states continue to fight. Yet Ms. Barra in a letter to environmental groups on Monday said she is pulling the plug on GM’s defense of the Trump Administration and urged other auto makers to do the same.
In joining the legal fight, GM had hoped to negotiate a settlement between the two sides, she explained, but “we believe there is now a path to achieve agreement on a national standard and complementary policies.” That standard will now be dictated by California, which has banned sales of gas-fueled cars by 2035. 
“We believe the ambitious electrification goals of the President-elect, California, and General Motors are aligned, to address climate change by drastically reducing automobile emissions,” wrote Ms. Barra. She made this announcement after meeting with California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols, who has been floated as a possible Biden EPA Administrator.
GM last week said it expects EVs to become more profitable as battery costs decline and driving range improves. That would be fantastic, literally—but dealers who don’t want to be stuck with unmovable inventory aren’t buying Ms. Barra’s electric hype. Hence GM is offering $500,000 buyouts to Cadillac dealers that “choose not to participate on our EV journey.” 
GM is trying to ingratiate itself with regulators so it can steer future fuel-economy standards. Two years ago, GM called for a national electric-car mandate with juiced-up regulatory credits for its trucks and driverless cars. GM also proposed to replace the 200,000 per manufacturer cap for the federal $7,500 EV tax credit—which it no longer qualifies for though most of its competitors do—with an industry-wide phase-out once electric cars exceed 5% of the U.S. light-duty fleet. 
Other ideas include a mandate for EV chargers in new homes and federally funded “K-12 education programs, and media programs that highlight the benefits of driving electric.” Perhaps China, which dominates battery production, could assist with the propaganda. We don’t want to hear GM caterwaul when it gets thrown by regulators under its own electric bus.

2020/11/25,A Pardon for General Flynn,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-pardon-for-general-flynn-11606348768,"President Trump’s decision Wednesday to pardon former national security adviser Michael Flynn is an overdue act of justice that ends four years of political harassment, unjustified prosecution and judicial abuse. If it sounds like we feel strongly about this one, you’re right.
We’ve never met the former general and decorated veteran. But every American should be worried about his mistreatment by a politicized system of justice that could happen to anyone on the wrong side of vindictive people with power. 
The FBI and Justice pursued him though they knew there was no basis for an investigation. They coerced a plea of lying to the FBI though the interviewing agents thought he was telling the truth. A later re-examination ordered by Attorney General Bill Barr found that Justice and the FBI had withheld exculpatory evidence. Former FBI director James Comey crowed about how the bureau took advantage of the unsuspecting Mr. Flynn and a trusting White House to have his agents interview him without courtesies normally extended to criminals. 
Justice finally moved to dismiss the charges this year, but then federal Judge Emmet Sullivan opted for political revenge by refusing to agree to the dismissal. He even tried to investigate the case himself—an extraordinary intrusion by a court into the executive branch’s prosecutorial power. His obvious goal was to stall long enough for a Biden Administration to take power and reinstate the charges. What a disgraceful performance.
Mr. Flynn should have been vindicated in court, but Judge Sullivan was never going to give him a fair hearing. A pardon was the only avenue left to prevent Mr. Flynn from more years of punishment. Congratulations to Mr. Trump for sparing an innocent man who served his country well but was ill-served by too many of his countrymen.

2020/11/26,A Speedy Recovery Depends on More Aid. Will Trump Deliver?,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-speedy-recovery-depends-on-more-aid-will-trump-deliver-11606420721,"Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent the Senate home for recess without passing a new coronavirus relief bill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he will pull the plug on several of the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending facilities. What are these men thinking?
Yes, the recent news on the vaccine front is wonderful. We are all indebted to the scientists who have worked so long, hard and successfully on the various vaccine projects. Thanks to them, the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel is dimly visible. But only dimly. Widespread vaccination is many months away. As Yogi Berra might have said, this horror show “ain’t over.”
When Congress passed the Cares Act in March, the pandemic looked absolutely frightening. The act was a sloppy piece of legislation with many flaws. But it had two huge virtues: It was big, and it came fast, both of which helped pull the economy back from the abyss. The pandemic is now worse than it was then. Yet Mr. McConnell is a roadblock to more relief funds.
Remember, it was Cares, plus a few other laws, plus rapid actions by the Fed, that enabled the economy to make what looks like a V-shaped recovery—so far. The expected tsunami of bankruptcies hasn’t materialized—so far. It even looks possible—so far—that the feared scarring of both workers and businesses may be limited.
Senators and the public need to understand that it was Cares and the rest that propped up the economy “artificially” as the virus was pulling it down. But now, with Covid-19 raging uncontrolled, most of the Cares money has been spent and more will expire in late December; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moratorium on evictions will end Dec. 31; and Treasury intends to end its lending facilities by the end of the year as well. 
Americans are suffering from the tragic results of the Trump administration’s malign neglect of the virus. Will we now have to suffer from malign neglect of the economy? Don’t think the Federal Reserve can ride to the rescue if Congress fails. Not because the Fed doesn’t want to help. But because there isn’t much more it can do. 
Think about the additional policy measures that have been mentioned. One is increasing purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities under quantitative easing. Another is moving those purchases out to longer maturities. The Fed may and should do both. But no one should seriously think such policies will have large effects on the economy.
Another option would be switching to yield-curve control, as practiced in Japan. That means replacing QE with pegging the yield on one or more Treasury maturities for a while. I’m sympathetic. But again, how much effect can yield-curve control have when yields on long-term Treasurys are already so low? Will U.S. borrowing rates go negative? I doubt it.
So it’s up to Congress and what’s left of the Trump administration. They should be working overtime on a compromise fiscal package in the range of, say, $1 trillion to $2 trillion. As Jason Furman recently argued on these pages, the economy can’t wait until the Biden administration takes office.
The package should have many components. Most obviously, the country is still short on critical items such as test kits and personal protective equipment. State and local governments, which are on the front lines in the battle against the virus, urgently need several hundred billion dollars in federal aid. They must balance their budgets even as they shoulder huge new costs for health care, school safety, security and more—and watch their tax receipts wither.
With light now showing at the end of the tunnel, it makes sense to help small businesses survive with more grants and soft loans. Economists generally view bankruptcy as a normal and necessary part of capitalism. But most of the small businesses now on the brink didn’t get there through poor business decisions.
Last but certainly not least, tens of millions of Americans need a lifeline. It isn’t prosperous, white-collar workers like me—and probably you, dear reader—who need help. It’s society’s underdogs: the unemployed, people of color, the poor and so on. 
These folks have pretty straightforward needs: cash income, food, shelter and health care. The federal government knows how to provide these things. If it fails, the light at the end of the tunnel may prove to be an oncoming freight train.
Mr. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton, served as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, 1994-96.

2020/11/26,The Truth About Chinese Bonds,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-truth-about-chinese-bonds-11606420312,"Here’s some advice for investors trying to make sense of recent turmoil in China’s domestic bond market: Good luck. Beijing appears to be gearing up for what could become one of its most consequential financial reforms, at a time when the economy is recovering from the pandemic.
China’s roughly $15 trillion domestic bond market has been upset by the defaults of two state-owned borrowers. Yongcheng Coal and Electricity Holding Co., owned by Henan’s provincial government, recently defaulted on a $152 million bond. Huachen Automotive Group, BMW’s joint-venture partner owned by Liaoning province, missed a similar payment last month.
These companies held sterling credit ratings, seemed healthy, and investors thought the firms enjoyed implicit backing by the local governments. The defaults have caused bond yields to spike for similar firms as investors worry who might default next.
This isn’t merely an accident. Beijing has understood for many years that out-of-control debt poses a mortal danger to China’s economy. Financialization boomed after 2008, typically involving collateral arrangements and corporate structures of baffling complexity. Debt expanded far more than the rate of economic growth, providing convenient cover for corruption and imperiling the investments of middle-class households.
Beijing appears to view a new wave of defaults as an opportunity to implement reforms. The central government’s warning to state-owned enterprises and their local-government patrons in recent weeks has been: Pay up.
The Financial Stability and Development Committee, Beijing’s main financial regulator, said Sunday it will crack down on fraud and “misappropriation of funds” and warned governments to create a healthy “credit environment.” The strategy appears to be to create a more normal financial market. Yongcheng Coal got the message and negotiated concessions with creditors this week.
That’s the right approach. A root cause of China’s debt explosion is rampant mispriced risk, caused in part by investors’ perception that few state-owned firms would ever default.
But this is also one of the most challenging reforms Beijing has undertaken, and not only due to inauspicious timing in a pandemic. China lacks many of the institutions that allow Western capital markets to function in the face of default risk, especially a legal system capable of adjudicating creditors’ claims and a free press able to dig into corporate fiascoes.
Both elements would help in the most recent defaults. The companies appeared to be profitable so it’s not clear why they didn’t repay on time. Western courts are expert at answering such questions and protecting creditors. Chinese courts lack that expertise. Local financial reporters are doing yeoman’s work following the trail, and an early test of Beijing’s sincerity will be if it allows unimpeded journalism in these and other cases even though the companies enjoy local Communist patronage.
Beijing’s gamble is that, with a sufficiently deft touch, the central government can harness bad debts in the cause of overdue financial reforms. Maybe it will work, but a controlled burn of the financial underbrush always carries the risks of becoming a forest fire.

2020/11/26,Debating the Integrity of the 2020 Election ,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/debating-the-integrity-of-the-2020-election-11606417884,"Regarding your editorial “Georgia Certifies: Donald Trump Lost” (Nov. 21): The Journal spent much of the last year running several editorials outlining the many troubles with mail-in voting, its easy susceptibility to fraud and the concerted Democratic efforts through lawsuits to overturn state laws as written by the legislature to force mail-in voting, especially in the swing states. Over the four years before that, the Journal editorial pages (but not the news pages) shone the spotlight on the phony Russia hoax that started with the false Steele dossier.
The attitude of 95% of the media is that no one better ask any questions or doubt the absolute veracity of the vote count, and we are expected to disregard the testimony of many eyewitnesses to what went on. What will keep the same thing from happening in future elections?
John M. Blust

You are absolutely correct that if state legislatures choose to overrule the state’s vote it would have grave consequences for the GOP. But it goes far beyond a danger to the GOP. Without proof of fraud, and putting aside the legality of the decision, by overruling the vote and ensuring a Trump presidency, state legislatures would be threatening the foundation of democracy. There is simply no reason for citizens to participate in elections if the vote can be ignored by a state legislature that doesn’t like the result. 
Matt Elbert

Whether Mr. Trump’s attorneys can prove their claims in court remains to be seen, but serious questions have been raised about the validity of the ballots tabulated in a handful of states. In order for the electorate to have faith in the outcome, these questions must be addressed and fully answered.

2020/11/26,Child-Care Access Is Good Policy for Families,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/child-care-access-is-good-policy-for-families-11606417803,"Your editorial “A Family Policy Warning” (Nov. 20) cites a single study about Austria to make the broad claim that child-care affordability “likely won’t have the transformative effects that proponents hope” in the U.S. One study on Austrian maternal employment is slim evidence to claim that American initiatives for affordable and high-quality early child care will fail. 
American children need high-quality child care, but hardworking families struggle to afford it. Over 80% of parents shoulder the full cost, which exceeds $20,000 a year in 22 states. The current system isn’t working. Over 86% of child care is market based, but the child-care market doesn’t respond to typical supply and demand forces. The supply would increase if parents could choose their provider based on quality, rather than solely on cost.
After Washington, D.C., began offering two years of universal preschool, the city’s maternal labor-force participation rate increased by about 12 percentage points, with 10 percentage points attributable to preschool expansion. On Nov. 3, over two-thirds of Coloradans voted for Proposition EE. This initiative will generate over $2 billion over 10 years to support universal preschool for four-year-olds in the state.
Despite decades of well-intentioned philanthropic interventions and state-by-state initiatives, many American families are still priced out of high-quality child care. Lawmakers must consider implementing policies like Proposition EE nationally. Is society not responsible for the well being of our next generation? One study may highlight issues with Austria’s policies, but much other evidence points to significant educational and socio-economic benefits of high-quality child care and we must provide it.

2020/11/26,Hard to See Something Like the Draft Again,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/hard-to-see-something-like-the-draft-again-11606417675,"Michael Sanger expresses a worthy and honorable sentiment in his Nov. 18 letter regarding the value of military service toward promoting a stronger sense of civic virtue within our nation. Unfortunately, whatever its virtues, a reinstitution of the draft is neither practicable nor consistent with the deeper military traditions of the American experience.
In 2017 the U.S. population of 18- to-24-year-olds was approximately 31 million. The Army currently rejects about 70% of volunteers for being unfit due to one reason or another, so how universal would universal national service, military or otherwise, really be if only nine million of 31 million potential recruits can pass the entrance requirements? Given that our current active-duty military is 1.3 million, conscripting only those reasonably fit to serve would require expanding our current military infrastructure by a factor of about seven. Will the American people accept an active-duty military of more than 10 million service members, much less pay the costs demanded?
Perhaps a better solution would be a strengthened system of locally based reserve components, a reconstituted structure of the militia within the several states. This would be more in keeping with the Founders’ original concept of civil-military relations and promote the positive civic virtues Mr. Sanger rightly advocates.

The Twitter mob didn’t want to read Ms. Shrier’s book; it objected to the content and wanted Target to keep others who might want to read the book from accessing it. Mr. Silverman is also wrong to suggest that the dangers of book banning stem only from governmental actions. In many ways, a book ban coerced by a Twitter mob is a greater danger to free speech, since it is less controllable by judicial or democratic means.

2020/11/27,Who Is an American ‘Person’? ,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-is-an-american-person-11606519964,"Who counts as a “person” for Congressional reapportionment under the Constitution? That’s the question the Supreme Court takes up Monday in a challengeto President Trump’s order excluding undocumented immigrants from state population counts (New York v. Trump).
Democratic states say Mr. Trump’s order violates the Constitution and 1929 Reapportionment Act and will result in their losing Congressional seats after the 2020 Census. Lower courts agreed. The “merits of the parties’ dispute are not particularly close or complicated,” wrote a three-judge panel in New York. Not so fast. 
The Constitution says “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.” The Reapportionment Act, which fixed the number of House representatives at 435, includes the same language and directs the President to transmit to Congress a “statement showing the whole number of persons in each State . . . as ascertained under the . . . decennial census of the population” using the “method of equal proportions.”
Persons mean persons, lower courts held. But as Justice Antonin Scalia once wrote, “The good textualist is not a literalist.” During debates at the Constitutional convention, framers referred to “persons” as “inhabitants.” A draft included “inhabitants” but was cut by the Committee of Style.
Democratic states agree the Constitution shouldn’t be read so literally as to include tourists or other transients fleetingly in a state during the Census. But they argue that “inhabitants” at the nation’s origin meant people with a “usual” or “customary” residence in a state, which would include undocumented immigrants.
This interpretation is too simplistic. It’s important to recall that illegal immigration was foreign to the Founders. Aside from the Chinese Exclusion Act, Congress didn’t significantly limit immigration until the 1920s. Undocumented immigrants didn’t make up a sizable enough share of any state’s population to affect reapportionment until the late 20th century. 
The Justice Department makes a compelling argument that the founders would not have thought “anything ‘usual,’ in the sense of ‘customary,’ about residing in a country in ongoing defiance of its laws.” By New York’s argument, even immigrants who are detained or paroled subject to a removal hearing should be included as “inhabitants” for reapportionment. Many undocumented immigrants have lived in the U.S. for years and intend to stay. Nonetheless, they aren’t permanent residents under U.S. law and could be removed at any time.
The Court in Franklin (1992) ruled that the President enjoys some discretion over reapportionment when it upheld the Commerce Department’s decision to end the practice of excluding overseas federal personnel from the population bases for their home states. Census enumeration and reapportionment practices weren’t set in stone at the founding.
What is indisputable is that undocumented immigrants are skewing representation in Congress. The Pew Research Center estimates undocumented immigrants in 2016 made up 3.3% of the U.S. population and 3.6% in New York but significantly more in New Jersey (5.2%), California (5.6%) and Texas (5.7%). 
Vermont and West Virginia stand to benefit from Mr. Trump’s order, while Texas and California could lose seats. So this isn’t a strictly partisan dispute. But the inclusion of undocumented immigrants in reapportionment has provided a perverse incentive for “sanctuary states” to impede federal immigration enforcement. This undermines constitutional federalism, which the Justices will no doubt have in mind during oral arguments.

2020/11/27,Home Is No Haven for Iran’s Regime,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/home-is-no-haven-for-irans-regime-11606519724,"The killing of Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh should be a message to Joe Biden and his nascent administration. Even as Iranian intelligence has pushed aggressively to expand its external influence via regional proxies, its domestic counterintelligence capabilities have significantly weakened. This is only the latest in a series of attacks that underscore the extent to which foreign intelligence services have been able to penetrate the country. Such attacks undermine the regime and could encourage domestic unrest. Mr. Biden should factor in this weakness as he prepares to negotiate with Tehran. 
State media in Iran reported that Fakhrizadeh, 59, had been assassinated in the town of Absard. According to the reports, gunmen opened fire on the vehicle carrying Fakhrizadeh, who was also an officer in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Tehran’s elite military force. Iranian officials and unnamed U.S. officials say Israel was behind the attack. 
This comes two weeks after intelligence leaks showed a top al Qaeda leader, who had been enjoying sanctuary in Tehran since the destruction of al Qaeda’s headquarters in Afghanistan nearly two decades ago, had been killed by Israeli operatives in an operation that was outsourced by U.S. intelligence. Earlier in the summer, Iran was rocked by a wave of unexplained explosions around the country, hitting at least one nuclear site. All these attacks point to an elaborate campaign designed to counter Iranian efforts to develop nuclear technology, especially for military purposes. 
Israeli efforts to prevent Iran from crossing the nuclear Rubicon go back to the late 2000s. But the bigger story is the sheer scale of Israeli or U.S. intelligence capabilities in Iran. Tehran’s security forces are obsessed with spying to the point that they have targeted many Iranians with Western citizenship. And Iran’s security establishment is known for effective tradecraft when it comes to intelligence and military operations involving proxies on its borders.
It’s ironic that such a country would become so vulnerable internally. This state of affairs suggests that external operations have been made possible at the expense of domestic security. It highlights a significant weakening of Iranian domestic security infrastructure, which is a maze of multiple entities: Law Enforcement Force of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ministry of Intelligence and Security, IRGC, Basij, etc. 
For Iran’s adversaries to pull off so many operations so quickly means there is a significant scale of local recruitment and management of cutouts. In many ways growing public anger against the regime in the last decade or so—including last year’s protests and brutal crackdown—has provided a recruitment-rich environment for foreign intelligence services.
The clerical regime is running into a credibility problem—with its proxies in the region, but more important among its own citizens. An Iran with internal security weakness is less likely to advance its radical regional agenda. More significant is that it faces the potential for sustained unrest from its own people, who suffer from economic pain and the chokehold of an autocratic state. 
Tehran’s response will be tied to its need to try to extract a new agreement from the U.S. that can relieve a harsh sanctions regime. The Biden administration will be dealing with a weak regime and should negotiate from a position of strength to avoid the mistakes of the Obama nuclear deal.

2020/11/27,"Biden, Iran and the Bomb",Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-iran-and-the-bomb-11606519663,"The Democratic establishment will soon be back in charge of U.S. foreign policy, and the question is how much they’ve learned in exile. One early test will be Iran, and whether Joe Biden will abandon the strategic gains that President Trump has made in the Middle East in a rush to return to the deeply flawed 2015 nuclear deal.
The apparent assassination of a top Iranian nuclear scientist near Tehran on Friday shows that Iran’s nuclear program remains a global security problem. No one took responsibility, but any number of countries have reason to act now in case the Biden Administration returns to a policy of appeasing Iran.
The U.S. left the nuclear accord in May 2018 and embarked on a “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign. After restoring pre-deal sanctions, the Trump Administration has added new restrictions across the Iranian economy, which is rigged to enrich the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and elites in Tehran. The White House plans to announce more sanctions through Jan. 20.
The sanctions have succeeded in weakening the rogue regime. Today Tehran exports about a quarter of the 2.5 million barrels of oil a day it shipped when the U.S. was still in the deal. This deprives the government of $50 billion in annual revenue. The economy has shrunk, while the Iranian rial has lost 80% of its value against the dollar.
Iran has responded by increasing its violations of the nuclear deal. It now has 12 times the limit of enriched uranium allowed under the accord, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said this month. It also is enriching uranium to 4.5% purity, above the 3.67% allowed under the deal but far from the 90% concentration needed for a bomb.
That Iran was able to ramp up its nuclear production so quickly is a reminder of the agreement’s major flaws. The IAEA also said this month that Iran’s explanation was “not credible” after investigators found nuclear material at an undeclared site. “We continue to be extremely concerned by Iran’s actions, which are hollowing out the core non-proliferation benefits of the deal,” the United Kingdom, France and Germany said in a statement responding to the IAEA report.
Yet Mr. Biden has vowed to return to the deal if Tehran begins honoring its commitments. “A Democratic Administration should immediately re-engage nuclear diplomacy with Iran and look to establish something along the lines of the [nuclear deal], but immediately begin the process of negotiating a follow-on agreement,” Mr. Biden’s choice for White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told our colleague Walter Russell Mead this year.
But what kind of agreement? The original nuclear deal makes it easy for Iran to break out as its provisions sunset over the next decade. Meanwhile, it provided cash for Iran to expand its regional influence and terrorism. After signing the 2015 deal, Iran increased its military budget more than 30% between 2016 and 2018, and its proxies in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen benefited.
The Trump sanctions forced Iran to cut back on that support, and the killing of terror chief Qasem Soleimani was a loud deterrent. To abandon sanctions again in return for more Iranian promises would be diplomatic and strategic malpractice. At a minimum the Biden team can use the sanctions as leverage to close the loopholes in the 2015 accord.
That should include no sunset, unlimited inspections of suspect sites, limits on ballistic missiles, and restraints on Iran’s regional imperialism. If Iran refuses, then we’ll know its goal continues to be regional domination rather than to become a normal country.
The Middle East has also changed for the better since Democrats were last in charge. Israel and the Sunni Arab states are normalizing relations after decades of conflict, and one reason is their shared worry about Iran. The Arab-Israeli conflict over Palestine is no longer the dominant issue.
President Trump gave both sides assurance that the U.S. is on their side, in contrast to Barack Obama’s loud disdain and his strategic embrace of Iran. If Mr. Biden rushes head-long back into the nuclear deal, he runs the risk of blowing up that regional progress.
Why would Mr. Biden want to throw that away? We understand the emotional attachment that Mr. Sullivan and other Biden advisers have for the 2015 nuclear deal. But time and Iranian behavior have exposed that deal as even worse than it looked at the time. Mr. Biden’s foreign-policy team should be thankful for the stronger hand Mr. Trump is leaving them.

Eddie, as friends called him, was a professor at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business and had previously taught for 20 years at the University of Chicago.

The Society of Labor Economists has established a prize in Eddie’s name for contributions to the field.
He also served his country as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2006-2009. He helped President George W. Bush navigate the end of the housing mania, panic and crash that the Federal Reserve and Congress had helped to create. 
Eddie was a frequent contributor to these pages, helping readers understand how to interpret the job market, tariffs, immigration and other subjects. His analysis followed where the data led.
He favored immigration reform based on education and wrote in 2018 that “my analysis of Census Bureau data from 2011-15 shows that immigrants are about 20% more likely than native-born Americans to found new companies.” He was especially prescient in warning in the last decade that the country wasn’t at full employment despite a historically low jobless rate.

2020/11/27,The Social Media Fact-Check Farce,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-social-media-fact-check-farce-11606519380,"In recent years liberals have successfully lobbied social-media companies to police conservative content more and more aggressively. But there’s little evidence that this political interference has reduced the prevalence of misinformation online—and a new study shows how it could make the problem worse. 
In the study—by Dino Christenson of Boston University and Sarah Kreps and Douglas Kriner of Cornell—volunteers were shown a May 26 tweet by President Trump attacking mail-in voting and claiming that “Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed.” 
Groups of participants were also shown “corrections” to Mr. Trump’s tweet, including Twitter’s “explanatory text labeling the claims ‘unsubstantiated’ according to major media outlets, including CNN and the Washington Post.”
Conservatives did not find mainstream-media assurances convincing. For Republicans who were shown Twitter’s effort to debunk the President, “belief that mail voter fraud occurs was more than 13% higher than in the control.” Or as the authors put it, “corrections increased misperceptions among those predisposed to believe President Trump.”
Great job, Twitter: In your Resistance zeal, you may have increased the salience of the mail-fraud idea among Mr. Trump’s core supporters. The overall effect was a wash, the authors find, because Democrats were more likely to believe the corrections. But when it comes to Republicans, the site may have played into Mr. Trump’s hands.
It’s not a mystery why this might be. Twitter and the mainstream press—to put it gently—have done little to demonstrate to Mr. Trump’s supporters that they are honest reporters of fact and judges of news. And this was before Twitter’s outrageous October blackout against New York Post reporting critical of Joe Biden’s family.
Twitter is now dotted with corrections to tweets alleging voter fraud. Mr. Trump’s post-election claims of massive fraud are dubious and undermine confidence in elections. But they are slowly collapsing from their own lack of evidence, not because of social-media corrections.
The marketplace of ideas is a better engine for sorting truth from falsehood than self-declared gatekeepers who have earned no social authority. Big Tech companies would serve themselves and the country better by not wading deeper into this political thicket.

This is the case with governmental power. We are all, in a sense, fools, since no one person can know everything. We all have to trust others for their expertise, and we all make mistakes. The horror of a command economy is not that officials will make mistakes, but that those mistakes will never be acknowledged or corrected.
What about our allegedly market economy? Who will be held accountable for destroying it? No doubt the destruction was carried out in good faith, but the shutdown didn’t accomplish what it was supposed to accomplish. 
We have seen shameless incompetence rewarded before.
Consider Prof. Frederick Lindemann, a close adviser to Winston Churchill during World War II. He treasured his access to the prime minister. Experts couldn’t get near Churchill unless they came through Lindemann. He feuded with everybody he perceived to be a threat, and was especially threatened by Sir Henry Tizard, who helped to develop radar, one of the most useful tools in the war effort. Naturally Lindemann mocked it. Later, Lindemann dismissed the possibility that the Germans were developing a liquid-fueled rocket capable of bombing London—the V-2.
Lindemann was feted and honored to the end of his days.
Or consider Joseph Stalin’s science adviser, Trofim Lysenko. He, too, had complete access to the boss. He believed that plants, like good Communists, could be educated—that peas and wheat could be trained to grow in winter. The Soviet ministry of agriculture, acting on Lysenko’s bogus theories, managed to ruin crops all over Eurasia and starve as many as 10 million people. Later his ideas influenced agriculture policy in Mao’s China and killed several million more. 
Lysenko was a talented flatterer. He outlived Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev, dying peacefully in 1976.
Now we have climate change and its attendant alarmists. In 2001 a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted a recent study claiming that the Earth’s temperature had risen dramatically during the period coincident with the introduction of fossil fuels—the famous “hockey stick graph.” The news media, backed by those parts of the “scientific community” the media chose to honor, presented this analysis as though it were indisputable fact. In fact, it was riddled with problems. That would have been fine—no harm done—except that the American left, and the running dogs in education and the press, saw the fear occasioned by the hockey stick as an opportunity. No correction was forthcoming. 
Most recently we have Covid-19. The New England Journal of Medicine reports that masks are useless outside health-care facilities, that there is little possibility of catching the virus from a “passing interaction in a public place.” Happy news, save that they, one week later, issued a squishy semiretraction, saying, in effect, “It couldn’t hurt.” 
What could the shutdown hurt? A pandemic was allowed to destroy the American economy. Tens of millions are driven out of work, cover their faces, and walk down the streets in fear of their neighbors.
A friend owns a restaurant. He is going broke. He had seating outside, but winter approaches and heaters are back-ordered until next spring. He is holding on. One is “permitted” to sit at his tables and eat without a mask. Indeed, how would one eat while wearing one? Does the virus know that one is sitting down?
He greeted two regular customers the other night, and sat at their table to chat. He took off his mask. The customer informed him that the regulations stated that employees of a restaurant are required by law to wear masks at all times. The owner put his mask on and rose. But does the virus know he is an employee of the restaurant? With whom would he argue, being an employee and a proprietor? With the virus?
The virus here is government—or at least the incompetents who advise our rulers and cannot admit the legitimacy of dissension. Absent intervention, this virus may eventually kill the host organism.

2020/11/27,Covid Was Hiding Among Colds and Flus,Business World,https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-was-hiding-among-colds-and-flus-11606519224,"Here are some Covid realities that we’ve long alluded to that might be useful to spell out in the current surge.
U.S. government scientists now estimate that 40% of cases are asymptomatic and 80% of symptomatic cases are mild—in short, 88% of subjects don’t know they are infected or have no great incentive to find out if they are suffering from Covid or some more familiar bug. 
An American adult typically suffers two colds a year, while school-age children may suffer 10 or more, and 20 million of us get the flu. A conservative estimate, then, is that 13 million Americans every day suffer from something not readily distinguishable from mild Covid (never mind asymptomatic Covid).
This perhaps explains why, despite conducting 186 million tests since the plague arrived, we’ve found only 12.7 million cases. Most who have Covid aren’t getting tested; among those seeking tests the large majority are suffering from something that isn’t Covid.

The implications have been slow to sink in. Embarrassing as America’s early testing fumbles were, the consequences were likely small. The odds were heavily against us being able to detect multiple outbreaks, seeded here and there by travelers from overseas, amid millions of colds and flus. (Indeed, false positives from every kind of test would have swamped any effort to identify Covid cases before they reached a critical mass.)
Government should have quickly freed the market to supply the diagnostic testing that the public demanded, but such testing was never a means to control the epidemic or even measure it. Maybe 186 million tests a week would do the trick, but not over nine months.
Though Donald Trump and the media enjoy obsessing about each other, a Washington fix was never in the cards beyond mobilizing supplies and expediting a vaccine. The job was always going to fall on the shoulders of 330 million Americans, with guidance from local leaders, to adapt to oscillating waves in their communities.
Recent British random testing revealed that 86% of Covid carriers were asymptomatic (at least for Covid) at the time of testing. An Italian study finds Covid was present in Europe three months before it exploded in Wuhan. The new virus was always more widespread and invisible than we wanted to realize. What causes it to explode suddenly on local hospital systems remains a puzzle. One lesson appears to be that a sensible strategy, rather than broad lockdowns, should focus narrowly on superspreading activities among the young and then the occasions by which the virus is transmitted to the elderly and vulnerable. 
A wit once said war is too important to be left to the generals. In a similar vein, the political consequences of Covid are so dramatic that even experts have been bewitched by the imperative to mythologize the pandemic. A disease that infects 10 million people and kills 2.5% will kill the same number as a disease that infects 100 million and kills 0.25%, but they need to be approached differently. The latter is what we’ve been facing. The former is the picture we have been consistently painting for the public with our obsession with “confirmed cases.” 
Such collective delusions don’t occur because every contrary wisp is silenced. Quite the opposite: The cat was constantly escaping the bag. Harvard’s Marc Lipsitch, a media favorite, was an early skeptic of the test-and-trace panacea given symptomless spread. In April Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker all but admitted to an uncomprehending radio reporter that such efforts were a show for the public.
A few leaders— Angela Merkel in Germany, New Jersey health chief Judith Persichilli —were clear that most citizens should expect to encounter the virus. But even German and New Jersey politicians have emphasized “confirmed” cases because it gives the illusion of control. Ditto the media, because the illusion of controllability allows politicians to be blamed for not controlling it.
No major U.S. media outlet has yet broken with this convention. In Britain, by contrast, two separate efforts have been under way for months using random testing to form a more realistic picture of the pandemic. Likewise, a U.S. Senate committee last week heard evidence that the drug hydroxychloroquine, instead of being a cure-all, is effective in the disease’s perversely untreated early stages. This was too much nuance for our press. It mostly reverted to the story line that HCQ is a useless drug that Mr. Trump promoted. 
We have a media that overwhelmingly sees its job as repeating things, rather than finding things out and understanding them. A free press has been less of an asset in dealing with Covid than it might have been.

2020/11/27,Nobody Knows I’m a Bad Chess Player,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/nobody-knows-im-a-bad-chess-player-11606518981,"‘The Queen’s Gambit,” the streaming television drama about fictional chess prodigy Beth Harmon’s quixotic quest for glory, was Netflix’s most popular show until surpassed by “The Crown.” You might say it was captured by the queen. 
The entertaining miniseries based on the Walter Tevis novel raised chess’s profile. It also likely terrified would-be players who were intimidated by what they saw. Ms. Harmon plays entire matches in her mind, visualizing every move and countermove. She also can play multiple chess games simultaneously, moving swiftly from one board to the next.
If this seems impossible, it isn’t. In recent years I’ve been on the losing end of the aptly named Fool’s Mate—checkmated in two moves. A completed game like that isn’t hard to visualize. Anyone can stride confidently in the park from board to board, provided no passerby sticks around to see how badly you’re playing each game.
No one should be intimidated by chess. You don’t have to be, or pretend to be, a savant. You don’t even need a live opponent. All you need is a smartphone and an account on a site like Chess.com. There you can play at any skill level—even none whatsoever—and always find a game.
This isn’t as demoralizing as live chess, in which your teenage nephew, who calls his knight “the horse” as he insouciantly checks Instagram, beats you effortlessly. Online you’re a grandmaster, as far as everyone else in the family room is concerned.
As my own example suggests, you don’t have to be good at chess to enjoy it. Spatial reasoning is such a weakness of mine that when staying in hotels, I can’t immediately identify my side of the bed. Despite this tactical deficiency, I have a tremendous time playing chess.
Some of this is patriotism. On Chess.com, my opponent’s national flag appears prominently underneath his online avatar. When I see anything other than Old Glory, it’s no longer a friendly game. It’s a grand geopolitical struggle.
This, in turn, raises the stakes of every move: I didn’t sacrifice a pawn, America did. It isn’t quite the exhilaration Winston Churchill described of being shot at without result, but the feeling you get when your queen escapes capture is heady.
Such tension leads to the occasional outburst. After all, face-to-face rules of etiquette don’t apply. Frankly, I play computer chess the way NBA center Dikembe Mutombo guarded the paint in his prime—demonstratively and loud.
When this happens, my kids roll their eyes and say, “Dad, it’s just a bot.” To this I reply, “A bot flying the tricolor flag of India, the birthplace of chess.” I don’t expect them to understand the pressure I feel. 
Consider a game for yourself in a quiet moment this winter. If you do, and whatever else you do, protect your queen. Especially against Emir from Turkey.

2020/11/27,Hispanic Trump Voters Annoy Obama,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/hispanic-trump-voters-annoy-obama-11606518338,"Remember the “coalition of the ascendant” that was supposed to give the left a permanent political advantage? The popular theory among pundits held that Barack Obama’s coalition of young people, minorities and white liberals would create an electoral lock for Democrats as coalition members became a larger share of the U.S. voting population. Now Mr. Obama himself recognizes that the theory isn’t holding up. In 2020 Donald Trump captured a larger share of the Hispanic vote than in 2016 and his predecessor is struggling to understand what happened. Mr. Obama’s early analysis seems to require some fact-checking.
On Wednesday Mr. Obama opined on the popular “Breakfast Club” radio show:
Kudos to the BBC for pointing out some of the holes in this analysis. The network reports:
And even some U.S. media outlets aren’t buying the former president’s analysis. “Obama’s take on evangelical Hispanics could reinforce Democrats’ challenges” is the headline on a Washington Post report from Eugene Scott. He notes:
Mr. Scott also notes:
Steve Cortes of the Trump campaign says that the impressive results of the Trump economic program also attracted many Latino voters.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that such voters are up for grabs and that there are no guarantees in U.S. politics. In 2002, John Judis co-authored “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” which advanced the idea that demographics were creating a long term advantage for Democrats. But in 2017 he admitted error:
That’s because these are huge, diverse populations and not as easily characterized as Mr. Obama might think. “We’re not one-issue voters,” says Mr. Cortes.

2020/11/27,Noonan Focuses on the Wrong Bogus Dispute ,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/noonan-focuses-on-the-wrong-bogus-dispute-11606514021,"Peggy Noonan’s “A Bogus Dispute Is Doing Real Damage” (Declarations, Nov. 21) has it exactly backward. Coming off four years of consistent cries of illegitimacy regarding a duly elected president, accompanied by overwhelmingly negative mainstream media “coverage” and the baseless and degrading Brett Kavanaugh and presidential impeachment hearings, it’s President Trump’s staff and supporters who are now undermining democracy? 
Bogus? While many scenarios over the past four years aptly fit this description, the recent two weeks of investigation, justifying further pursuit in the judicial arena, is as legitimate as it gets. Ultimately the issue is less about Donald Trump and more about half of the electorate’s belief in the integrity and credibility of, and confidence in, a system in which only those votes legally cast get counted. Far from bogus, it is the least that can be done to help establish future-election integrity.
Martin Gibson
Ahwatukee, Ariz.
I remember Democrats calling for Donald Trump’s impeachment and posing with “resist” signs before he was even inaugurated. I remember Rep. Adam Schiff saying that he had evidence that the Russians engineered the election of Donald Trump, knowing from intelligence agencies that it wasn’t true. I remember President Trump being impeached over a phone call to the president of Ukraine.
Richard Levy 
Washington
I find Ms. Noonan’s concerns about the damage to our Republic to be about four years too late. The irreparable damage was already inflicted by an alliance between the Democratic Party, our own government and the formerly objective press, all of which colluded and sought to remove a duly elected president with spying and fabricated “evidence.”
The continuing investigations of the election process are hardly “bogus.” Ms. Noonan needs to understand that about half the electorate feels the same way.
David Dow
Norway, Maine
This isn’t a bogus dispute if it focuses concern and sheds light on the real issue: That historically solid voting practices were watered down supposedly due to Covid. The effort to understand what happened is worthwhile.
Mike Brown
Chesterfield, Mo.
The real long-run damage is likely to be to the Republican Party. Many of the nearly 74 million who voted for President Trump did so because they want a country with a smaller federal government, fewer needless regulations and a more self-reliant citizenry.
These Republicans believe in and cherish the democracy that the Founding Fathers risked their lives for and the integrity of the electoral process they created. They don’t support baseless claims about the validity of what was likely the most secure and honest election in history.
The fact that most Republicans in Congress have been silent in the face of the administration’s fraudulent attack on the legitimacy of this election, and that some have even abetted the charade, erodes these Republicans’ faith in their party. The party of Ronald Reagan would have vigorously defended the electoral process. The Republican leadership needs to do this now and put an end to this travesty before too much damage is done to our democracy and the Republican Party.
Dan Thornton
Des Peres, Mo.
If I recall, Hillary Clinton advised Joe Biden not to concede the election “under any circumstances.” Is Donald Trump simply taking her advice?

2020/11/27,American Idealism in Practice and Theory,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-idealism-in-practice-and-theory-11606513758,"Fareed Zakaria’s “The World Needs American Idealism Again” (Review, Nov. 21) should be required reading for every American. That “collective security and collective endeavors were in each nation’s self-interest” should be obvious to all. Mr. Zakaria also astutely observes that the U.S. “chose to forgive, rebuild and rehabilitate the vanquished” after its victory in World War II. He elided an important point: Without those rebuilt vanquished powers, the U.S.’s ability to sell its products more broadly would have been greatly diminished. John Donne observed almost 400 years ago: “No man is an island.” Isn’t it time for Americans to fully embrace that idea?
Marc Chafetz
Washington
America was never the pillar of idealism. “Pax Americana,” the fairy tale of peace and prosperity that supposedly blanketed the world after 1945, is entirely wishful thinking. Ask all the folks in Poland, Romania, Albania and Hungary who were sold out at Yalta and who after encouragement to revolt and promises of our support were misled and abandoned. What really followed World War II was global chaos including revolutions and civil wars, a Cold War, hot wars in Korea and Vietnam and brutal coups. We overthrew numerous democratic governments and routinely interfered in other nations’ free elections. There were awful race riots here in the U.S., genocides in Rwanda and Cambodia and most recently Syria, and I could go on.
It’s simply amazing that anyone could look at the shameful way we behaved in places like Laos, Cambodia, Iran, Egypt, Guatemala and El Salvador, and suggest that somehow we built a “rich legacy” of aspirational moral authority that made the world a better place. Such a view of our role in the world is naive and misleading at best, fraudulent at worst.
Doug Thomas
Lancaster, Pa.
As a former owner of a small business that supplied products and services to manufacturing companies in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, I am amused by Mr. Zakaria’s high-sounding idealism that masks the social, economic and health devastation wreaked by globalist policies that shut down thousands of American factories and shipped them to Mexico and China. We often remarked at work that we would get rich in our business if only we could keep our customers open. Instead, year after year, more and more of our large manufacturing plants shut down and moved overseas or went bankrupt. This had disastrous downward ripple effects in local communities, affecting everything from local property taxes for schools and government to coffee shops. Unemployment, poverty and drugs moved in. Of course neither Mr. Zakaria nor his neighbors suffered any of these consequences. Hence his blithe mouthing of empty globalist rhetoric. Citing President Eisenhower when America, not China, was factory to the world, is laughable. What would Ike think of the fools who wilfully destroyed the “Arsenal of Democracy”? That issue is the core of President Trump’s “America first” policies on trade, taxes, energy and immigration, and it is the source of his widespread support.

Unlike his predecessors who have never seriously tried to make such deals, he should be credited for at least trying. Our country’s elected and appointed leaders have always allowed other countries to take advantage of our caring generosity, and this has been foolish and very costly to American manufacturers and consumers. In China’s case, American companies with manufacturing operations there are even forced to share private technology.
President Trump has been adamant about leveling the playing field and requiring foreign countries like China to play the trading game fairly and honestly. He may not have been as successful as we hoped, but he should not be criticized for trying.

2020/11/27,The Constitution Will Survive Covid-19,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-constitution-will-survive-covid-19-11606502792,"The Covid-19 pandemic “has served as a sort of constitutional stress test,” Justice Samuel Alito observed this month. “The pandemic has resulted in previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty.” The setting underscored the point: Justice Alito made his remarks in an online speech that ordinarily would have been delivered in a cavernous hall, before a crowd of hundreds gathered for the Federalist Society’s annual dinner.
A public-health emergency may justify curtailments of liberty that would be unacceptable in normal times. But even in an emergency, America’s government doesn’t wield unlimited powers. Measures taken to deal with this pandemic have imposed severe restrictions on the most basic rights and liberties, often with little consideration of their legal basis. The U.S. Constitution prohibits many of the most draconian measures taken or under consideration. 
Joe Biden has implicitly acknowledged the point. Accepting the Democratic presidential nomination in August, the former vice president declared: “We’ll have a national mandate to wear a mask—not as a burden, but to protect each other. It’s a patriotic duty.” But his transition website promises only to “implement mask mandates nationwide by working with governors and mayors.”
A federal mask mandate is a nonstarter because it would have to be grounded in one of Congress’s constitutionally enumerated powers, all of which have limits. The go-to section to justify federal regulation is the clause granting lawmakers the power “to regulate commerce . . . among the several states.” As the Supreme Court held in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), which involved the ObamaCare mandate to buy medical insurance, individuals must be engaged in commercial activity before Congress can regulate them. Congress cannot impose requirements on the citizenry “precisely because they are doing nothing,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.
The same is true of other prospective federal anti-Covid measures, such as a national “stay at home” order or an overall economic lockdown. Congress does have broad authority to regulate business, which it could use to impose workplace safety rules, including mask mandates. But nationwide lockdowns are a dubious legal proposition. Congress has never attempted to eliminate all or most economic activity. Any such requirement, even if supportable under the Commerce Clause, would raise significant concerns about the constitutional rights of people prevented from earning a living.
State and local mandates pose a more complicated question. Unlike the federal government, states have a general “police power” that permits them to enact public-health regulations. State and local mask mandates will likely survive judicial scrutiny, as the burden is relatively small. But quarantine requirements imposed on otherwise healthy people, and especially stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of economic activity, are another matter.
Courts have generally upheld quarantines as proper exercises of state police power. But they have traditionally required the involuntary seclusion only of infected individuals and those exposed to them. Quarantines for travelers may survive constitutional challenges. They are generally limited to 14 days or less and arguably supported by the states’ interest in limiting the potential to spread the infection from viral “hot spots.”
But states have no constitutional authority to discriminate against out-of-state persons, goods or services or to burden interstate commerce unduly. It would be hard to justify restrictions that draw arbitrary distinctions between intra- and interstate travelers or among states. New York’s current rules, for instance, exempt travelers within New York and from adjacent states while ordering quarantine for those from distant states with lower Covid rates.
Universal, open-ended stay-at-home mandates and general economic shutdowns are unprecedented in America. The former amount to the imposition of house arrest on vast numbers of people without due process or any provision for basic needs. They raise important constitutional issues involving freedom of assembly, due process and equal protection. 
Mandating how many individuals can meet in one’s home, as some states did in time for Thanksgiving, is particularly difficult to justify. If the government can regulate your dinner guests, what can’t it do? Although the government has imposed location-specific curfews in times of war and civil disorder to address specific public-safety concerns, protracted populationwide curfews directed at more-nebulous threats will be difficult to justify. 
Some of these issues will doubtless reach the Supreme Court, but lower courts are already wrestling with them. In County of Butler v. Wolf, William S. Stickman IV, a federal district judge in Pittsburgh, struck down Pennsylvania’s most draconian anti-Covid-19 measures. These included strict limits on indoor and outdoor gatherings, stay-at-home requirements, and the lockdown of businesses that aren’t “life-sustaining.” Judge Stickman found these measures wanting on First Amendment, due-process and equal-protection grounds, even under an “intermediate” level of scrutiny.
“A public health emergency does not give Governors and other public officials carte blanche to disregard the Constitution for as long as the medical problem persists,” Judge Stickman concluded in his September decision. He took particular note of Pennsylvania’s diversity of communities—and hence of Covid risks—as against the state’s “one-size fits all approach” to stay-at-home orders, which were not in any way tailored to minimize the burden while achieving the government’s legitimate ends. 
Judge Stickman concluded that Pennsylvania’s business lockdown requirements failed to meet even the lowest level of constitutional scrutiny—being rationally related to a proper state purpose. He noted that the state had not articulated “a set, objective and measurable definition” of “life-sustaining” businesses, and that its requirements arbitrarily favored large retailers over small ones. Pennsylvania has appealed Judge Stickman’s decision, but it is difficult to see how the state can defend such capricious and comprehensive restrictions. The same goes for other states: Such details as closing health clubs but not beauty salons (New York), or imposing restrictions on the use of sailboats but not motorboats (Michigan), appear driven not by any rational basis but by government officials’ aesthetic and ideological preferences.
No doubt some judges will be inclined to defer to government officials in an emergency. Five Supreme Court justices did so earlier this year when churches in California and Nevada sought to enjoin state orders limiting the number of worshipers at services. In both cases, Chief Justice Roberts voted with the court’s four Democratic appointees to deny immediate relief. 
But the other four justices dissented in both cases on the grounds that the orders violate freedom of religion by imposing greater limits on religious activities than comparable secular businesses, including casinos. As Justice Alito quipped during his Federalist Society speech: “Take a quick look at the Constitution. You will see the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which protects religious liberty. You will not find a craps clause.” 
This Wednesday the court granted injunctive relief to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and an Orthodox synagogue, which are challenging New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s occupancy limits. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the new 5-4 majority. In a concurring opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch observed that the state had ignored “long-settled principles” that almost always prohibit government officials “from treating religious exercises worse than comparable secular activities.”
One area in which the states clearly can impose anti-Covid mandates is vaccinations. In Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), the Supreme court upheld the city of Cambridge’s authority to respond to a smallpox outbreak by mandating vaccines for all inhabitants. The justices affirmed that “the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand.” 
Congress may also be able to impose vaccination or testing on employees or others engaged in commerce. But proponents of economic lockdowns overreach when they cite Jacobson in support. The case was modest in scope and dealt with a far surer remedy for a deadlier virus than Covid-19. 
Federal and state officials have every right to urge Americans to take precautions against viral spread, though it would help if they consistently followed their own advice. But when the government moves beyond persuasion to coercion, its requirements must meet constitutional muster. 
Some of them will, such as well-tailored state-level mask and vaccination mandates. Others probably won’t, including broad curfews, stay-at-home orders, economic lockdown mandates and measures that target protected First Amendment activities. There may be a “judicial impulse to stay out of the way in times of crisis,” Justice Gorsuch wrote in the New York case. “But . . . we may not shelter in place when the Constitution is under attack.”
Messrs. Rivkin and Casey practice appellate and constitutional law in Washington. They served in the White House Counsel’s Office and Justice Department under Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

2020/11/27,Fireworks Over Religious Liberty,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/fireworks-over-religious-liberty-11606420438,"Wow. That word rarely applies to Supreme Court opinions. But it does in our view to the Court’s order on Thanksgiving eve enjoining New York’s Covid-19 order restricting attendance at religious services. The Court is back as a sentinel protecting the free exercise of religion, even in a health emergency.
The Court’s order is a temporary injunction pending review on the merits by lower courts and perhaps eventually the Justices. But the rhetorical firepower unleashed in six separate opinions shows that convictions run hot at the Court on this subject, as well they should given the stakes for American liberty that has itself been enjoined by politicians in the pandemic.
In an unsigned 5-4 per curiam decision, the Court blocked as discriminatory Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s arbitrary limits of 10 or 25 people in houses of worship in certain Covid hot spots. The petitions came from the Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Agudath Israel of America, which represents Orthodox Jews (Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo). 
“Members of this Court are not public health experts, and we should respect the judgment of those with special expertise and responsibility in this area. But even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten,” the Court writes. “The restrictions at issue here, by effectively barring many from attending religious services, strike at the very heart of the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious liberty.”
The Court explains that New York’s order treats houses of worship more harshly than what Mr. Cuomo considers “essential” businesses. Those include liquor stores, bike shops, acupuncturists, lawyers, accountants, and more. 
As Justice Neil Gorsuch puts it in a corker of a concurrence: “So, at least according to the Governor, it may be unsafe to go to church, but it is always fine to pick up another bottle of wine, shop for a new bike, or spend the afternoon exploring your distal points and meridians. Who knew public health would so perfectly align with secular convenience?” This disparate treatment discriminates against religion.
The four dissenters, including Chief Justice John Roberts, argue that an injunction isn’t necessary because Mr. Cuomo has already rescinded his orders. But the majority explains that Mr. Cuomo could reinstate or change them at any time, as he often has, and the plaintiffs would suffer immediate injury as they wait for courts to grant relief. Anyone who has watched Mr. Cuomo operate in the pandemic knows he relishes his role as master of the universe. On bullying brand as always, he dismissed the Court's order as “philosophy and politics.”
The order shows that new Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s vote was decisive. The Court ruled against previous religious appeals in the pandemic, and Justice Gorsuch unloads on the Chief Justice’s May opinion in a California case (South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom ). The Chief had cited a precedent from a century ago to argue for deferring to the authority and expertise of local officials in an emergency. 
“Even if the Constitution has taken a holiday during this pandemic, it cannot become a sabbatical,” Justice Gorsuch writes. “Rather than apply a nonbinding and expired concurrence from South Bay, courts must resume applying the Free Exercise Clause. Today, a majority of the Court makes this plain.” 
The Chief replies that Justice Gorsuch makes too much of a single sentence in his South Bay opinion. But the sharp exchange highlights the differences on the Court between the Chief’s political pragmatism and the majority’s adherence to first constitutional principles. The opinions also make clear the frustration of the conservative Justices with the Chief’s restraint in protecting core constitutional rights.
While the 5-4 order is welcome, it is disappointing that the ruling wasn’t 9-0. New York’s restrictions on religious worship are so overbroad, and so arbitrary, that their violation of the Free Exercise Clause should be an easy call. Americans have tolerated extraordinary restraints on their freedom in the pandemic, but it’s increasingly clear as we learn more about the virus that too many Governors have needlessly infringed on basic rights. 
And too many judges have acquiesced. Americans should welcome the Supreme Court back at the ramparts as a defender of liberty.

2020/11/29,Canceling Student Debt Would Be a ‘Brahmin Bailout’,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/canceling-student-debt-would-be-a-brahmin-bailout-11606687827,"The economist Thomas Piketty used postelection surveys taken from France, the U.K. and the U.S. to track a remarkable evolution in left-wing political parties: “from the worker party to the high-education party.” He noted in a 2018 paper that leftist parties in the mid-20th century relied on less-educated and lower-income voters to form their electoral base. But more recently these parties have come to rely on college graduates. Mr. Piketty refers to this new base as the “Brahmin left,” as in the Indian upper caste.
The transformation of the Democratic Party has been summarized aptly by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who in 2016 boasted, “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in Western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.” The strategy didn’t work for his party that year, but in the 2020 presidential election it bore fruit. Strong performance in the educated suburbs allowed the Democrats to capture new territory, including Arizona and Georgia.
Political parties are coalitions of voters; as bases evolve, so do policies. It is hardly a surprise that Mr. Schumer, who has pushed the Democrats to embrace a suburban strategy, is now advising President-elect Joe Biden to forgive up to $50,000 in federal student-loan debt for every graduate.
Canceling student debt would play well with the Democrats’ growing base of educated elites. But how much would it help the workers who once formed the backbone of the Democratic Party? Sen. Elizabeth Warren claims forgiving student debt would be the “single biggest stimulus we could add to the economy.” 
But Jason Furman, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, writes that this debt forgiveness “likely has a multiplier close to zero,” because it would be taxable. Matt Bruenig, founder of the left-wing People’s Policy Project, writes that forgiving student debt is “possibly the least effective stimulus imaginable on a dollar-for-dollar basis,” because “normal stimulus measures try to put money in people’s pockets so that they can spend it. But student debt forgiveness does not do this. It’s like giving out $1+ trillion that is then immediately garnished by creditors, leaving households with no extra liquid cash to spend.”
Some would counter that forgiveness will help unburden Americans weighed down by student debt. But note which Americans will get most of the benefit. As the Brookings Institution’s Adam Looney found last year, Ms. Warren’s proposal to forgive up to $50,000 of debt for Americans whose households earn less than $250,000 a year is regressive. Under her plan, the bottom 60% of households would receive only 34% of the benefit. That’s because college graduates—even the ones who went into debt to pay for their degrees—tend to be relatively affluent. Were the government to forgive $50,000 for all Americans without Ms. Warren’s $250,000 cap, the result would be to transfer even more money to wealthier Americans.
A blanket forgiveness of student debt would be a Brahmin bailout, delivering economic benefits to the upper class while doing nothing for the trucker in Toledo, Ohio, or the Waffle House waitress in Atlanta. It would increase divisions between the college-educated and the rest of the country without reforming the student lending system or bloated universities that created the debt problem.
The federal government instead could let current borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates, allow student loans to be discharged through bankruptcy, or require colleges and universities to repay some of the loan balance of students who are unable to do so themselves. These ideas, offered by senators as ideologically diverse as Ms. Warren and Missouri Republican Josh Hawley, recognize that student debt is a real problem. But they don’t propose a large transfer of income to some of the wealthiest people with the best prospects in America.
Stopping the Brahmin bailout would draw a line in the sand for the Democratic Party. It can choose to spend up to $1.6 trillion in taxpayer dollars to cancel all student debt—as socialist standard-bearer Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed during his presidential campaign—or it could focus resources instead on the least among us. Brookings’s Melissa Kearney has estimated that we could eliminate most child poverty in the U.S. by enacting Social Security benefits for poor children at an annual cost of $179 billion.
Seeking votes and campaign money, Democratic politicians have correctly decided that America’s college-educated elite are a key to both. But should they build policy around the narrow interests of this elite, they risk further polarizing Americans along the class divide. That’s a recipe for igniting a populist movement that would make Democrats look back at the Trump years with affection.

2020/11/29,Deploying Big Data to Determine How Well Vaccines Work,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/deploying-big-data-to-determine-how-well-vaccines-work-11606687711,"The Food and Drug Administration may approve a Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use within the next few weeks. Within days of that green light, millions of doses will start making their way to patients. The distribution and administration will be logistically complex and difficult. And the study of a vaccine’s safety and efficacy doesn’t end with FDA approval. Researchers will be gathering evidence on how well these products work in the real world.
The vaccine is likely to reduce the odds of serious or symptomatic infection. But will vaccinated patients be less likely to be infected at all? Do the vaccines confer, as preliminary evidence suggested, “mucosal immunity,” in which immune cells in the respiratory tract can help reduce the chance of spreading the virus? If so, parts of the country with low spread and high rates of vaccination may be able to ease up on mitigation measures like wearing masks and distancing.
Public-health authorities also need to monitor which patients received a particular vaccine and make sure they follow up for the second dose that most of these vaccines require to be fully effective. 
It will also be important to track the vaccine’s risks. Some patients may have rare and potentially serious health events. The important question is whether those events are happening at higher rates in those vaccinated than in those who aren’t. Other questions: How long does the protective benefit last? Is the vaccine less effective in some patients? 
The best way to answer these questions is through randomized clinical trials. That’s why the vaccine makers will continue to follow the tens of thousands of patients in trials for at least two years. But with millions of people being vaccinated, there are opportunities to learn at a far larger scale.
Extensive research on safety and effectiveness for previous vaccines has been developed through systems such as the Vaccine Safety Datalink and the FDA’s Sentinel and BEST (Biological Effectiveness and Safety) initiatives. These collaborations involve the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Medicare, private health plans, large health systems and health-technology companies. 
These efforts put together and analyze secure, anonymized registries of the vaccine use and health outcomes of large patient populations. Medicare is working with the FDA and CDC on such an approach for studying Covid vaccines in Medicare patients, and a broader public-private collaboration could be even more useful.
The CDC is setting up a national Covid registry to track information on vaccine use that will be connected with state vaccine registries. Ideally, this registry would have mechanisms to pass along pertinent data to a patient’s doctor and health plan. Clinicians and plans would be better able to follow up on their patients, monitor for unusual adverse events, and reach out to those not vaccinated. Health plan sponsors may receive vaccination data on some of their patients through billing, but not everyone will get vaccinated in a doctor’s office or pharmacy. Federal and state governments are establishing special administration sites that may operate outside traditional insurance.
One way to handle this is for the federal government to set up secure data links for health plans and clinicians. Another approach is through Medicare. The federal government is paying for all vaccines, but Medicare expects to receive claims paperwork that will include some information on everyone who receives a vaccination. Medicare could pass along this data to the health plans in Medicare Advantage and the prescription-drug plans in Medicare Part D, as well as to the primary care providers of Medicare patients. States could also use their registries to provide similar information to Medicaid plans and providers. 
There is still a little time to iron out approaches for those outside government health programs, since most of the early vaccinations will be given to older patients covered by Medicare and to health-care workers. 
The vaccines in development are promising, but society won’t benefit without a distribution and monitoring system that allows Americans to be inoculated in a safe and timely manner. Yet with careful work and ingenuity, the most serious disruptions of the pandemic could be history in a matter of months.

2020/11/29,Notable & Quotable: Trump,Notable & Quotable,https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-trump-11606687613,"From “The Biden Popular Front Is Doomed to Unravel,” by Christopher Caldwell, New Republic, Nov. 23:

The problem for Trump’s reelection was not that his response was too anti-lockdown and loosey-goosey. On the contrary. It was that the lockdowns imposed were draconian enough to disfigure the economy. Covid-19 . . . subjected the country to the most plutocrat-enriching trimester in its history. Plumbers and waiters were suddenly without incomes, and Uber rides dropped 80 percent. The economy shrank at an annualized rate of 5 percent in the first quarter of 2020 and by an astonishing 31.4 percent in the second. But the giant internet retailers boomed. By late summer, Jeff Bezos had added $90 billion to his wealth on the year. The country rebounded with 33.1 percent growth (again, annualized) in the third quarter. The good news was published by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis on the Thursday before the election to much fanfare from Trump, but this looked more like through-the-looking-glass surrealism than trustworthy economic policy. And besides, by then much of the country had already voted.
That is the second way Covid-19 brought about Trump’s loss: It rendered irresistible the pressure to broaden access to ballots and pioneer new forms of voting that on election night would cut Democrats’ way.

2020/11/29,Venezuela’s Guide to Election Theft,The Americas,https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-guide-to-election-theft-11606684680,"On Wednesday six plaintiffs filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, the secretary of state and four others. The complaint alleges “massive election fraud” to help Joe Biden win the Nov. 3 election for president. 
It further alleges “the fraud was executed by many means, but the most fundamentally troubling, insidious, and egregious is the systemic adaptation of old-fashioned ‘ballot-stuffing.’ ” This was “amplified and rendered virtually invisible by computer software created and run by domestic and foreign actors for that very purpose.”
The plaintiffs want Georgia to decertify the election. The 104-page complaint is now before the federal court, which will review the material presented and make a ruling. 
Central to the argument against the governor and his associates is the claim that software used by Georgia was developed by Hugo Chávez —who died in 2013—to steal elections in Venezuela. Critics are dismissing this as a fantastic conspiracy theory. But they should instead welcome and help to air it. 
Plaintiffs have collected affidavits, board-of-elections records, and other documentary evidence and under the law they are entitled access to the courts to present their grievances. Far from undermining American democracy, this demonstrates its strengths—and sets it apart from the likes of Venezuela, where elections are stolen with impunity. 
Venezuela’s practice of electronic election theft began with the 2004 recall referendum. It was riddled with irregularities. But Venezuelans were denied requests for a statistically sound audit while the Carter Center and former President Jimmy Carter, the Organization of American States, and the Bush State Department rushed to endorse the lack of transparency. It is a record worth reviewing.
The Chávez regime used an electronic voting system run by a company called Smartmatic. Computer experts allege that its software is the same used by Dominion Voting Systems in 28 states, including Georgia, earlier this month. 
The companies insist they are rivals. But since any voting software can be manipulated, whether there are links between the two wouldn’t seem to be the crux of the matter. 
The important distinction is the decentralized architecture around a U.S. election and the legal paths that challengers enjoy in U.S. courts. 
Chávez had already rewritten the constitution and fired 18,000 petroleum-industry workers in retribution for a strike at national oil-monopoly PdVSA when the recall vote was held. The idea that foreign observers were on hand to ensure fairness was a joke. The European Commission didn’t send an observer mission because, it said, it had “not been possible to secure” the conditions “to carry out an observation in line with the [European] Union’s standard methodology.” 
That was a polite way of saying that the police state made honest observation impossible. No matter, the Carter Center signed up. Its main role turned out to be blessing a dubious result and the dictatorship’s wall of secrecy in assessing what happened. 
On the day of the referendum, Sunday, Aug. 15, 2004, Venezuelans turned out in big numbers, confident that they could rid themselves of the antidemocratic strongman through the democratic process. An exit poll by the American polling company Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates found that Chávez lost his bid to stay in power by 59% to 41%. 
Yet, as I reported on Aug. 20, “at three o’clock on Monday morning two members of the National Electoral Council (CNE) who are politically opposed to Chávez announced that they had been shut out of the audit process and warned the public that the established protocol had been violated. Some 50 minutes later pro-Chávez CNE member Francisco Carrasquero emerged alone to proclaim Chávez the winner.”
The Carter Center went along with the announcement, as did the OAS, claiming that a “quick count” confirmed it. But as I reported, the quick count was merely a “look at the tally sheets spat out by a sample of voting machines.” The useful foreigners, I had learned, had not been “allowed to check this against ballots the machines issued to voters as confirmation that their votes were properly registered.” Three days later the Bush State Department caved in to Mr. Carter’s insistence that his friend Hugo had won. It announced “the people of Venezuela have spoken.” 
Venezuelans begged for justice. Enrique ter Horst, a Venezuelan and former U.N. deputy high commissioner of human rights, wrote at the time about his concerns in the International Herald Tribune: “The papers the new machines produced . . . were not added up and compared with the final numbers these machines produce at the end of the voting process, as the voting-machine manufacturer had suggested.”
Venezuelans never got their day in court, but Americans still get theirs. In the interest of securing the confidence of the electorate, court challenges ought to be allowed to play out.

2020/11/29,How to Stop the Paris Climate Accord,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-stop-the-paris-climate-accord-11606684590,"Joe Biden has promised to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord on day one, but President Trump could stop it from having any binding legal power.
President Obama signed on to the international agreement by executive action in 2015, which meant Mr. Trump could withdraw from it the same way, as he did in 2017. As per the terms of the accord, that withdrawal became effective on Nov. 4, 2020. Mr. Obama’s pledge to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions at least 26% by 2025 wasn’t legally binding. Only Senate consent to its ratification could have made it so—and the upper chamber would have rejected the treaty handily if Mr. Obama had submitted it. 
Yet if Mr. Biden brought the U.S. back into the accord, it’s possible it will take on the weight of law. Although there is nothing about the agreement’s terms or the manner in which the U.S. entered it that make it legally binding on the U.S., some green group may find a friendly federal court to produce that result. 
Example: Mr. Trump rescinded Mr. Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program, yet it remains in place. Although DACA was both created and reversed by executive action, the Supreme Court blocked its rescission in June on grounds that the Trump administration’s decision was “arbitrary and capricious” under the Administrative Procedures Act. The court’s rationale was procedural; the justices didn’t deny that the president can reverse a predecessor’s executive action. But creative lawyers and judges can find ways of blocking a new president from changing policies, with Congress never having a say.
To prevent the Paris Climate Accord from taking on such undue power, Mr. Trump should submit it to the Senate, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should schedule a quick vote. It would certainly be rejected—ratification requires a two-thirds vote—and it is unlikely any court could subsequently resurrect a legislatively tossed treaty. Without the help of judges, Mr. Biden would need a winning ratification vote to make the accord binding, which he likely couldn’t get no matter how well Democrats do in Georgia’s January runoffs and the 2022 midterm elections. 
Mr. McConnell could also call a ratification vote after Mr. Biden’s inauguration, even if Mr. Trump does nothing. This would similarly elevate the treaty’s status and make it difficult for Mr. Biden to bind his successors to his executive actions. 
Mr. Milloy publishes JunkScience.com, served on the Trump Environmental Protection Agency transition team and is the author of “Scare Pollution: Why and How to Fix the EPA.”

2020/11/29,Can Republicans Regroup on Health Care?,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-republicans-regroup-on-health-care-11606678968,"ObamaCare returned to the Supreme Court this month and the law seems sure to survive a legal challenge from GOP state attorneys general. That lawsuit has long looked like a futile exercise, and the real question for Republicans is: How many elections will the party lose before coming up with a potent political argument on health care?
For all the Republican success in Senate and House races, health care continues to haunt the GOP. John Hickenlooper, the Colorado Democrat who defeated GOP Senator Cory Gardner, set up the subtly named CoryGardnerWontProtectPreexistingConditions.com. Many others pounded the GOP as wanting to snatch away health insurance from Americans during a pandemic. Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly cut an ad touting himself as a defender of the vulnerable featuring a mother of a child with a heart defect. 
This playbook helped Democrats win the House in 2018, and you can bet they’ll reprise it in the January Senate runoffs in Georgia, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is running on defending the Affordable Care Act. “I want to live in an America where every family has great health care,” he tweeted recently, as if anyone disagrees with this bromide. 
Yet after trying and failing to replace the Affordable Care Act in 2017, the GOP seems more or less resigned to defeat on health care. At least a narrow Republican Senate majority could prevent a President Biden from passing a “public option,” the thinking goes. But that is merely a stay of execution until the next time Democrats control government. About two-thirds of Americans support a government plan that competes with private insurance, according to a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll. 
One reason that idea is popular is that Republicans have struggled to explain how a public option would exploit unlimited taxpayer financing to cannibalize competing insurers and move ever more Americans from generous employer insurance into plans that look like Medicaid. Some two-thirds of Americans who support Medicare for All (single payer) wrongly thought they’d be able to keep their current health insurance, Kaiser reported in October.
These polls suggest that what Americans really want isn’t single payer. They want protection from the risk that they or someone they love needs help paying for cancer immunotherapy or surgery. There is a political opening for policy that covers costs for the sick without compromising medical innovation or prompt access to care, and favors choice and competition over mandates and political control.
For instance: The Affordable Care Act’s subsidies function as transfers to insurers, not to patients racking up medical bills. Give the subsidy money to states to spend on those with pre-existing conditions through “high risk pools” or other arrangements. The Affordable Care Act’s mandates on benefits also preclude specialized plans for, say, diabetics or cancer patients. Allowing tailored options would better serve those with pre-existing conditions who are currently trapped in ObamaCare’s high deductibles and narrow doctor networks, as policy analyst John Goodman has written.
Under ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion, the feds paid states more to enroll prime-aged men above the poverty line than to cover the truly needy—even as Democrats claim to be the party of compassion. Republicans should broadcast that message across the suburbs and vow to correct the dysfunction.
The GOP also needs to think bigger than the individual market, which is not where most Americans are insured. Federal rules permit tax-preferred health-savings accounts to be paired only with plans that have a high deductible. Why not allow more Americans to control more of their own health-care dollars? Other good ideas include supporting direct primary care that offers preventive services for a low monthly fee, or improving reimbursement for telemedicine.
These and other ideas can be found in a recent policy blueprint produced and supported by center-right policy minds like Mr. Goodman, Grace-Marie Turner, Brian Blase and Doug Badger. They deserve credit for continuing to push this rock up the hill even without many champions in Congress. Republicans have lost muscle memory on health care with the departure of members like Tom Coburn and Paul Ryan. 
So far what Republicans have tried is writing bills on pre-existing conditions registering their agreement with Democrats on preserving ObamaCare’s mandates. Few have bothered to point out that only 2.7% of an estimated roughly 130 million people with pre-existing conditions gained access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.
It’s true the press will help the left disparage every Republican idea. But a public option that was too radical to pass as part of ObamaCare is now the moderate position in the Democratic Party, and the party’s goal remains a government monopoly on medical care. Republicans owe it to the country to be more than speed bumps on the road to single payer.

2020/11/29,Team Obama’s Iran Illusions,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/team-obamas-iran-illusions-11606678886,"After last week’s assassination of a top Iranian nuclear scientist, it’s hard to tell who is more upset: Iran, or Barack Obama’s foreign-policy team. Tehran is blaming Israel and promising revenge, but consider the tweets by the men who gave the world the flawed 2015 nuclear deal.
Former national-security aide and media spinner Ben Rhodes : “This is an outrageous action aimed at undermining diplomacy between an incoming US administration and Iran. It’s time for the ceaseless escalation to stop.”
And this from former CIA director John Brennan, leading promoter of the false Russia collusion narrative: “This was a criminal act & highly reckless. It risks lethal retaliation & a new round of regional conflict. Iranian leaders would be wise to wait for the return of responsible American leadership on the global stage & to resist the urge to respond against perceived culprits.” 
This turns the Middle East upside down, as the Obama foreign policy also did. The 2015 deal was supposed to restrain Iran’s nuclear-weapons development and moderate its regional behavior. It has done neither. But now the architects of that deal blame not Iran for its behavior but whoever is trying to slow Iran’s nuclear progress.
In other words, the Obama crowd is siding with Iran against Israel and the U.S. (though neither of the latter have claimed responsibility for the killing). The Obama crowd’s continuing illusions about their Iranian diplomacy shows that they have learned nothing in exile. Yet if Israel did plan the assassination, it surely did so because it fears that the same illusions about Iran are returning to U.S. power with the Biden Administration, and so it must act on its own.

2020/11/29,The Election Lost in Pennsylvania Court,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-election-lost-in-pennsylvania-court-11606678818," Nicole Ziccarelli is a 39-year-old lawyer, a mother of four, and a Republican candidate for state Senate in a district east of Pittsburgh. As of last Tuesday, it seemed she might topple a Democratic incumbent, Jim Brewster, whom Ms. Ziccarelli led by four votes, according to unofficial returns.
Today she’s behind by 89. What happened? After a state Supreme Court ruling, Allegheny County tallied some 300 absentee ballots that were in dispute due to incomplete voter declarations. These ballots have proper signatures, but the voter neglected to date them. Ms. Ziccarelli’s lawyers must be pulling their hair out: State law explicitly says that upon completing an absentee ballot, the voter “shall then fill out, date and sign the declaration printed on such envelope.”
But when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is around, the words in a statute are no guarantee. A bare majority, four of seven Justices, found that undated ballots are invalid. One of them, however, said the rule should apply only “prospectively.” This could now swing that state Senate seat, although Ms. Ziccarelli is appealing, according to her attorney, Matt Haverstick. “It is the outcome of the litigation that is now in federal court,” Mr. Haverstick says, “that’s going to decide this election.”
Imagine if Joe Biden or Donald Trump were in a similar position. Across Pennsylvania, there are thousands of undated ballots. The state Supreme Court’s ruling involved two batches: 2,349 in all of Allegheny County, as well as 2,470 in Philadelphia. If the presidential margin were a few hundred or thousand, instead of 80,000, it could be a huge deal. Statewide, mail votes broke 76% for Mr. Biden. Assuming the same ratio for undated mail votes, the question of whether to count the ballots in Philly and Allegheny alone would represent a swing of about 2,500.
We’ll spare you the creative legal explanations by the state judges, especially Justice David Wecht, who was elected as a Democrat. Suffice it to say that this is a perfect illustration of the problems with mass mail voting as it has been quickly grafted onto American elections: It introduces slack and too much discretion into the system. 
Some ballots show up late, whether the blame is on voters or lax deadlines or the post office. Other ballots are missing signatures, dates, secrecy envelopes and so forth. Local officials differ in what they decide to count. Many jurisdictions give voters a chance to fix faulty ballots, but many don’t. In a close election, all of this is catnip for lawyers and politically oriented judges.
There are good reasons to end the mail-vote experiment once the pandemic recedes. But at the least, state lawmakers should take this opportunity to go through their election codes and try to wring out this kind of ambiguity, as much as possible. The next election will be here before they know it.

2020/11/29,Another Bold Strike Against Iran,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/another-bold-strike-against-iran-11606672416,"Any American intelligence operative who’s worked on Iran has to tip his hat to Israel’s Mossad. The assassination Friday of Iran’s pre-eminent atomic-bomb scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, and, even more impressively, the warehouse heist of the clerical regime’s nuclear archive in January 2018, shows a level of risk-taking and accomplishment that has no U.S. parallel. In June there were large, damaging explosions at the Natanz uranium enrichment site, which probably weren’t caused by shoddy maintenance. 
The Central Intelligence Agency hasn’t been a particularly bold organization in decades (the aggressive interrogation of al Qaeda members may be an exception). It isn’t only the timidity of the CIA’s senior management and Washington’s political class that enfeebles Langley; it’s the absence of a mission against a state-threatening foe that focuses the mind and attracts real talent. An Iran with nukes would threaten Israel’s existence, not America’s.
Israel has been lethally penetrating the Islamic Republic for at least a decade. Mossad now appears to have stationary surveillance and hit teams positioned in the country. Given the level of internal dissent, which has spread even among children of the original Iranian revolutionaries, it’s possible Israel has acquired valuable agents in Iran’s armed forces and security services. 
Though the assassinations of Fakhrizadeh and others, such as Daryoush Rezainejad in 2011, may be the work of Iranian assets in Jerusalem’s employ—Kurds may be the most accessible and motivated—the archival theft is more likely an intrusion in which Israeli officers were on the ground in command. By comparison, it’s doubtful that the CIA has ever deployed a single nonofficial-cover officer inside Iran to sustain either intelligence collection or covert action since the failed Operation Eagle Claw hostage rescue in 1980. 
Fakhrizadeh had probably been an Israeli target for some time; the assassination’s timing might have been coincidental, dictated by a fortuitous intercept or piece of human intelligence that convinced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to go for it. But the Israeli achievements, which have continued despite the Iranian regime’s repeated attempts to thwart them, mean that Jerusalem can play havoc with the Biden administration’s hoped-for nuclear diplomacy. 
The signal to Democratic Washington is unmistakable: Jerusalem has the means, even without a conventional air attack against Iran’s nuclear sites, to challenge the supreme leader and his praetorians, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, who oversee both the nuclear and ballistic-missile programs, where it hurts most. If Israelis can kill Tehran’s most prized personnel and surreptitiously damage its guarded facilities, and Tehran can do little in response, then the clerical regime’s haybat, its unchallengeable awe, is degraded for all to see. For a regime that knows the extent of popular anger against it, that is a perilous situation.
Iran’s theocracy is deeply infected with conspiratorial anti-Semitism. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in particular has Jews on the brain, seeing concentric circles of enmity revolving around Zion. He has difficulty disconnecting Israeli actions from American consent. The Obama administration, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the lead, once spooked Israeli confidence about preventive military action against Iran’s nuclear program. This time, Jerusalem doesn’t have to be so ambitious. 
American will to intervene in the Middle East is declining rapidly, and Israel’s position is significantly stronger than it was in 2012, when President Obama began secret negotiations with Tehran in Oman. Israel has Iran in a corner, and Ayatollah Khamenei is obviously scared to escalate. Beyond Mossad’s actions, the Israeli Air Force has been pummeling the Revolutionary Guards and their proxies in Syria, fundamentally challenging Iranian plans in the Levant. Tehran has done little about it.
Joe Biden’s people, who were Mr. Obama’s people, played down Israel’s concerns about the Islamic Republic’s nuclear ambitions and imperialism. Trying to get these officials to pay attention to the many unanswered questions about the regime’s militarization of nuclear research and gaping holes in the verification procedures of Mr. Obama’s atomic accord was a hapless task. American flirtations with “moderate” President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif seemed to many Israelis a dance of naïfs. 
Distance gives the U.S. the capacity to test theories about foreigners. Being a hegemon encouraged others to follow even when they had doubts. But the evident huge increase in Mossad operations inside Iran isn’t only a byproduct of President Trump’s sympathy. It is an early sign of a new post-American order. Mr. Biden and his officials may try to twist Jerusalem’s arm to go easier on Iran. Good luck. The president-elect’s looming defense cuts will be more telling. The Middle East is all about power politics, and Mossad has begun to show what a committed First World intelligence service can do against a Third World Islamist state whose own security apparatus is increasingly decrepit.

2020/11/29,Beware the Dow 30K Euphoria,Inside View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/beware-the-dow-30k-euphoria-11606672322,"A great Wall Street lesson: Keep those decamillennial hats around. Last Tuesday saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average close above 30000 for the first time, but by Friday it was underwater again. Remember, more than 10 years passed between March 1999, when the market first crossed 10000 (with wild celebration), and November 2009, when it finally crossed that mark for good (hopefully). Even more time passed between when the market briefly crossed 1000 in 1966 and when it passed that mark permanently late in 1982.
It’s just a number, right? Yes, but blared across tickers, radio, TV, the web and now Twitter, market milestones symbolize progress. Or is it excess? Either way, they’re thought of as a scorecard of success. Oh what a feeling. In many ways, today’s market feels like 1999. Lower-than-expected inflation—check. Relative peace—check. Fed printing money—check. Plus new technological paradigms and IPO mania. Will it end the same way?
It’s easy to see why the market is booming. First, indexes overweigh successful companies (remember when General Electric got tossed from the Dow?). Thirty Dow companies and a cap-weighted S&P 500 mean trillion-dollar-valued companies drive the indexes. A quarter of the Dow’s past 10,000 points were provided by Apple alone.
Then add low interest rates—effectively zero, because there is a glut of capital and low demand for it. The Federal Reserve seems on course to keep rates low forever. The main reason is that we are in the midst of a serious digital dividend. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence and smartphone apps have driven huge productivity gains, in part by reducing each company’s need to build out its own infrastructure. Plus, work from home will mean fewer office buildings, less maintenance on roads and bridges, and less inventory in stores. Each Zoom call equals one less airline seat.
The market is paying for the digital dividend twice (or more). It pays for the profit upside of Apple, Amazon,Microsoft, Google and Facebook, but then again with high earnings multiples induced by low inflation. With interest rates near zero, the market pays up huge for future earnings. But not forever: For those keeping track, long-dated bond yields bottomed on Aug. 4.
But who cares? Wall Street loves a bull market. We’ve got IPO mania and SPAC attacks. If you can’t pull off an initial public offering, you can merge with a special-purpose acquisition corporation. This is how somewhat scandalized electric trucker Nikola became a public company. Buyer beware.
Is it frothy out there? Obviously. Software company Salesforce is selling at 100 times trailing earnings. Newly minted IPO sensation Snowflake is selling at 200 times . . . revenue! Through Sept. 30 U.S. venture capital funds had invested $88 billion, well above the $66 billion for all of 2000. It was $41 billion in 2012.
Traders often look at market signals like the volatility index and put/call ratios to identify speculation. Now they can just look at bitcoin, which still isn’t widely used for much of anything but is a pretty good speculative divining rod. It ran unimpeded this year to $18,000 but then sold off almost 10% of its bloat on Thanksgiving Day. It’s a reminder that stocks too can drop 10% at the drop of a hat.
Speaking of which—Tesla was recently added to the S&P 500, forcing $11 trillion in indexed money to clamor for its shares and driving its value to an eye-popping $555 billion. As I’ve said before, that’s a huge multiple on zero-emissions regulatory credits tied to a money-losing car business. Most think the Biden administration will keep the green juice flowing, so the Tesla train parties on.
How does it end? I can guess why but not when. Remember, a stock’s value is in expectations for future earnings, not what happened in the past. This market mania ends when reality doesn’t meet expectations and speculations. There are signs. The dollar is weak. In October spending was up 0.5%, but income was down 0.7%. That doesn’t sound good.
A Heard on the Street headline last week suggested: “Facebook Ads Could Be Reaching Saturation Point.” Apple’s gross margins are declining. Google has an antitrust dragon breathing on it. The oil and energy markets will eventually revive.
Perhaps the biggest risk to tech stocks is the one no one seems to consider: that Covid vaccines get distributed by next year, and that work from home, or WFH, rolls over and life returns to normal. “RTN” may be the ugly acronym of 2021. WFH stocks like Zoom, Amazon, Teladoc and maybe Netflix might still grow, but not as fast, failing expectations as life regresses toward the mean.
If you’re bold, enjoy the ride in the meantime. But please, don’t throw away those Dow 30K hats. Put them in the back of your drawer along with other not-quite-obsolete items, like that Keith Richards photo and your AOL password.

2020/11/29,"School’s Out, But It’s Not About the Children",Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/schools-out-but-its-not-about-the-children-11606665501,"Seth Barron is right (“School’s Out for Autumn in New York,” Cross Country, Nov. 21). The decision to close schools in New York is far from a “data-driven, science-driven” decision. The science that is missing is economics, in particular cost-benefit analysis, the branch of economics intended exactly for such decisions. Medical doctors can and should provide inputs and guidelines, but there are many other factors that should be explicitly quantified.
For example, a recent Wharton study suggests that every month of school closures can cost each student $12,000-$15,000 in lost future lifetime earnings. This is a low estimate of the damage since it doesn’t include the extensive social and mental-health costs as well as costs to parents who miss work as they care for children at home. These costs fall disproportionally on underprivileged students and parents. The same study calculates the expected cost to society of a Covid-19 infection at about $38,000 for September. 
This means that an infection rate of 0.355 per student a month warrants closing schools. In New York City the infection rate as reported to the state, including students and staff, is 0.0014 per student per month, which is dramatically lower. Even if the calculations are imprecise and based on many assumptions, they should give decision makers some pause. Incidentally, most European countries have kept their schools open despite rising Covid infections, and even Canada is keeping schools open through a Toronto lockdown. 
Prof. S. Abraham Ravid

As a substitute teacher in the New York City school system, I can say that Mr. Barron is absolutely right about the real reason Mayor Bill de Blasio, with the blessing of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, shut down our schools. Safety had nothing to do with it—it was to appease the unions. I opted out of the United Federation of Teachers last year because I didn’t want to contribute to an organization that, among other things, promoted the mayor. I haven’t contributed to a union that puts the convenience of teachers ahead of the needs of children and parents.
New York City never really opened school this year. Yes, on paper, the city offered “blended” classes but it’s easy to see the charade. Children from sixth to 12th grade were going to school once a week. The majority of teachers chose to teach remotely and so when children had their one day of classes, many were taught by substitutes like me. Children in the lower grades might have been in school every other day, but the restrictions were so onerous that after experiencing in-school “education,” I’m sure they were disappointed. 
So before any more journalists credit Mayor de Blasio for offering in-school education in New York City even for a few weeks, they should have a better understanding of what “in-school” really meant. And then the conclusion would be that the mayor and governor effectively shut down schools in September. On Thursday, Nov. 19, they just made it official.

2020/11/29,Bad Polling and the Accuracy of Predictions,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bad-polling-and-the-accuracy-of-predictions-11606665418,"Your editorial “The Price of Bad Polling” (Nov. 23) warns that bad polling causes all kinds of mischief, including reinforcing the perception of media bias, mobilizing or demoralizing voters and influencing turnout and making people even more skeptical of data presented with an imprimatur of scientific authority. The bad 2020 polling has only two explanations: innocent ignorance and poor polling methodology, or knowing use of poor methodology infected by media groupthink and a subconscious desire for a self-fulfilling, blue-wave prophecy. Republicans should trust political polls as much as they do news reports. 
While you are calling out pollsters for miserable performance, how about a shout-out to the Congressional Budget Office for routinely producing numbers with only a passing resemblance to reality, but usually treated by journalists as having the imprimatur of scientific authority? Remember the Federal Reserve’s consistently overoptimistic (i.e., wrong) GDP growth predictions during the Obama administration?
Some pollsters blame the silent, deplorable minority for throwing a monkey wrench into their projections and claim they got the big picture mostly right, a win for Joe Biden. Political polling is politics, not science. Science, particularly the settled-science variety, may not even be science anymore. Guesses by political pollsters, the CBO, the World Health Organization or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deserve the same assumption of scientific accuracy that a forecast for weather a week from now deserves.
Alex Williams
Sarasota, Fla.
I am of the opinion that data from flawed surveys or polling methodology are being used by many due to a widespread lack of understanding of sampling or polling theory. It seems that many in the media today think that they are survey sampling experts.
The only eight point difference in this election was an 8% higher popular vote total (79.8 million for Mr. Biden compared with 73.8 million for President Trump), which few predicted.
The final outcome, as we know, was 51.1% and 47.2%, interestingly enough just outside of the margin of error.
Mark Crowley
Naples, Fla.
Polls and surveys—my profession—naturally contain some “sampling error,” but that error should be random. The 2020 polls again showed systemic, not random, error consistently in the Democrats’ favor. Many sources of bias exist—e.g., instrumentation and response biases—but there’s also how the pollsters adjust their findings for the likely profile of the electorate.
The pollsters don’t understand how “non-college-educated whites” vote. And we wonder why the polls are wrong?
Perhaps the most interesting question should be posed to Facebook and Twitter, who flag or ban what they deem as falsehoods and misinformation. Given the consistent errors, shouldn’t polling data be banned from their platforms?

2020/11/29,Actors’ Equity Errs; More Eyeballs Build Demand,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/actors-equity-errs-more-eyeballs-build-demand-11606665325,"Regarding Terry Teachout’s “Theater Caught in a Union Headlock” (Sightings, Nov. 23): By keeping a lid on streaming broadcasts, the Actors’ Equity Association is ignoring a fundamental marketing insight that was demonstrated in Chicago by the contrasting views of two sports magnates, William Wirtz (Chicago Blackhawks) and P.K. Wrigley (Chicago Cubs). 
Wirtz kept the Chicago Blackhawks off television on the theory that people should and would pay for access to mediocre hockey by coming to Chicago Stadium. Wrigley realized that a broadcast of a Chicago Cubs baseball game, no matter how mediocre his team, was a three-hour advertisement for his product (a day out in the friendly confines of Wrigley Field) for which his organization was paid. 
A fixture on local television and ultimately on WGN, the Cubs developed a national following and made money despite years of failure on the field, while the Blackhawks’ fan base withered. When Bill Wirtz died, his son Rocky put the Blackhawks on television within 30 days, energizing new generations of young fans. Three Stanley Cups followed.
A broadcast game, or play, increases your reach and builds your audience. There is gold in those hearts, minds and eyeballs.

2020/11/30,Return of the Obama Economists,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/return-of-the-obama-economists-11606778301,"If Joe Biden is trying to distinguish his emerging Administration from Barack Obama’s , he hasn’t succeeded in the choice of economic advisers he rolled out Monday. They’re Obama veterans who believe in more spending, more regulation, higher taxes, and easier money. Let’s hope the result is better than what became known as “secular stagnation” during the Obama years.
 Janet Yellen, the Treasury nominee, is an economist with a distinguished political resume. She’s a Keynesian from the James Tobin school who believes in spending as fiscal stimulus and low interest rates. As Federal Reserve Chair in Mr. Obama’s second term, she was slow to raise interest rates and reduce the Fed’s bond purchases. She’ll likely favor a 2009-style policy mix next year with a spending blowout while urging the Fed to monetize it. 
Voters sent a complicated message this election, apparently denying President Trump a second term but handing Republicans down-ballot victories. Mr. Trump is challenging the vote counts in several states but remains a long shot to carry enough to win. Join WSJ Opinion to assess the election results and what they mean for the next administration. BEGINS 7:00 PM EST DECEMBER 2, 2020. 
Mr. Biden has also signed up Jared Bernstein, an architect of the Obama stimulus who famously predicted in January 2009 that spending would keep unemployment below 8% and hit 7% by autumn of 2010. Not quite. The jobless rate hit 10% in October 2009, stayed at 9.9% through April 2010, and didn’t fall below 7% until November 2013. Mr. Bernstein put his trust in the Keynesian “multiplier” that $1 of new spending yields as much as an extra $1.57 or more of additional GDP. Wrong again.
Mr. Bernstein will join the White House Council of Economic Advisers, where his boss will be Princeton economist Cecilia Rouse. She’s a veteran of the Clinton and Obama White Houses. Her academic work has focused on microeconomic subjects such as education and the labor market, and her research is skeptical of the benefits of school choice.
Mr. Biden’s National Economic Council that coordinates economic policy at the White House will be led by Brian Deese, another Obama veteran. Mr. Deese helped to design the 2009 auto bailout that was controversial for gutting bondholder contracts. In political exile he has worked for BlackRock, where he is the global head for sustainable investing—the political portfolio for environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. 
By the way, condolences to Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO, who has pushed ESG standards on the rest of corporate America but fell short in his bid to become Treasury Secretary. Mr. Deese’s powerful role is a consolation prize, and his selection shows again how Mr. Biden will make climate an economic priority.
That’s also the message from Mr. Biden’s choice of Neera Tanden to be White House budget director. She’s a ferocious partisan who is close to Hillary Clinton, with a Twitter record as acerbic as Donald Trump’s . She’s run the Center for American Progress, the Democratic think tank, and she favors much higher taxes. 
She is also a climate obsessive. In October 2019 she tweeted support for a proposal with “sector-specific deployment policies, trillions of dollars in direct federal spending, an economywide price on carbon, and mandatory emissions reductions in communities historically overburdened by pollution.” As budget director she’d supervise the shop that reviews regulations across the government.
That is, if she’s confirmed by the Senate. Ms. Tanden’s slash-and-burn rhetoric has made her many political opponents. That includes many on the left, who recall her role denouncing Bernie Sanders in 2016 on behalf of Mrs. Clinton. We see little difference between Ms. Tanden’s agenda and Bernie’s, but she may pay a price for her habit of casting opponents as enemies of the people.
The overall message of Mr. Biden’s picks is of a progressive team that views government as the leading engine of economic growth. Our guess is that they’ll use the lingering damage from the pandemic to propose a major spending and tax increase in early 2021. 
The irony is that on present trend Mr. Biden will inherit an economy that is recovering much faster than Keynesian economists predicted earlier this year. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has raised its estimate for fourth-quarter growth to 11%, and Wall Street economist Ed Hyman has raised his to 8%. 
This isn’t 2009. Once the Covid vaccine is delivered broadly, the economy should soar. The job of the Obama economists will be to keep it going, not dampen growth with the same policy mix that produced the slowest recovery in decades the last time they held power.

2020/11/30,Trump’s Fair Banking Rule,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-fair-banking-rule-11606778173,"Progressives are pounding banks to stop lending to industries they dislike. So credit to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks for putting banks on notice that they can’t red-line industries merely because they’re politically unpopular.
The Dodd–Frank Act charges the Comptroller with ensuring “fair access to financial services, and fair treatment of customers” by nationally chartered banks. Democrats who wrote that law wanted to make sure banks didn’t deny services to a class of customers simply because they carry a higher credit risk.
Voters sent a complicated message this election, apparently denying President Trump a second term but handing Republicans down-ballot victories. Mr. Trump is challenging the vote counts in several states but remains a long shot to carry enough to win. Join WSJ Opinion to assess the election results and what they mean for the next administration. BEGINS 7:00 PM EST DECEMBER 2, 2020. 
Instead, banks should “evaluate customers individually,” Obama -appointed Comptroller Tom Curry explained in 2014. “Higher-risk categories of customers call for stronger risk management and controls, not a strategy of total avoidance,” and banks should only reject customers whose risk they can’t manage “after appropriate due diligence.”
The OCC later issued guidance that banks should never terminate “entire categories of customers” and must evaluate and manage customer risks “on a case-by-case basis.” There’s no such thing as a risk-free loan. Even profitable businesses are vulnerable to shocks such as the pandemic. Successful banks manage risks rather than avoid them.
Mr. Brooks on Friday essentially proposed to codify the Obama-era guidance with regulation. This is especially important to do now since several large banks have recently announced plans to stop doing business with private prison operators, gun makers and fossil-fuel companies after liberal intimidation campaigns.
In 2019 activists protested on Valentine’s Day in front of J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s Manhattan apartment with a Mariachi band calling on him to “break up with prisons.” The bank later said it will “no longer bank the private prison industry.” Several large banks have red-lined oil and gas projects in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Under the proposed rule, banks with more than $100 billion in assets would have to evaluate the risks of individual customers and couldn’t red-line whole industries. Some banks have justified red-lining industries to guard against amorphous “reputation risk”—e.g., lending to gun makers could draw political attacks. The OCC proposal would require regulatory and legal risks to be quantifiable. Banks couldn’t refuse to underwrite oil and gas projects merely because of public opinion or putative environmental risk.
Pressure to disassociate from certain industries will grow because political intimidation is succeeding and banks may be eager to win goodwill with Biden Administration regulators. For-profit colleges, military contractors and businesses that don’t embrace the left’s identity politics could be targets. 
The rule could give banks political cover to repudiate activists, and potentially legal support to businesses to challenge their discrimination if they are red-lined. Public comments on the proposal are due Jan. 4, which should allow the agency to complete a final rule before Joe Biden takes office. 
Reversing the rule would take time and may not be a high priority, especially since many Democrats support its intent. Last year the House passed legislation by a 395-2 vote to prohibit federal agencies from demanding that banks cut off services to industries because of “reputation risks.” Rolling back the rule would entail political risk that a Biden Administration may wish to avoid.

2020/11/30,De Blasio Gets Schooled on Reopening,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/de-blasio-gets-schooled-on-reopening-11606778117,"Perhaps New York City parents didn’t know their own strength. In less than two weeks, Mayor Bill de Blasio went from shutting down in-person learning in the city’s public schools to reopening it for a large share of students. The reversal shows how public pressure can curb the power of the teachers union.
Mr. de Blasio announced Sunday that some elementary school students who have opted for in-person learning would return to classes on Dec. 7. The mayor explained his change of course since closing schools on Nov. 18 as a learning experience. “We proved that schools can be extraordinarily safe,” he said. “What we didn’t know back in July and August, we do know now.” Nice try.
Voters sent a complicated message this election, apparently denying President Trump a second term but handing Republicans down-ballot victories. Mr. Trump is challenging the vote counts in several states but remains a long shot to carry enough to win. Join WSJ Opinion to assess the election results and what they mean for the next administration. BEGINS 7:00 PM EST DECEMBER 2, 2020. 
Studies showing the relative safety of schools have been circulating for months, such as research from Germany’s Institute of Labor Economics, which led many European countries to keep schools open despite rising Covid-19 cases in the general public. The more likely cause of Mr. de Blasio’s change of heart is pressure from parents, some 335,000 of whom chose over the summer to have their children return to in-person learning in September.
Mr. de Blasio also jettisoned the district’s rigid standard for closing down. The United Federation of Teachers had demanded that schools close when the positivity rate on Covid tests in the city reached 3%. Mr. de Blasio now says the mandate for schools is to “find a new path that would be sustainable,” including more frequent testing and flexibility depending on each school’s capacity. 
The partial reopening will be a welcome change for parents, and especially for students who have suffered from stay-at-home online classes. Yet the selfish union opposition to classroom learning persists in too many places and grows more untenable by the day.

2020/11/30,China’s Wolf Warriors Try Wine Coercion,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-wolf-warriors-try-wine-coercion-11606777975,"Wine has now joined beef, barley, coal and timber among the Australian exports that China’s Communist Party is threatening to quash as part of its intimidation campaign against Canberra. 
China announced arbitrary tariffs between 107% and 212% on Australian wines Friday, citing antidumping rules. Perhaps this didn’t elicit the response Beijing had hoped, because on Sunday a Foreign Ministry spokesman sparked another diplomatic row by posting a fake image depicting an Australian soldier slitting the throat of an Afghan child. 
Voters sent a complicated message this election, apparently denying President Trump a second term but handing Republicans down-ballot victories. Mr. Trump is challenging the vote counts in several states but remains a long shot to carry enough to win. Join WSJ Opinion to assess the election results and what they mean for the next administration. BEGINS 7:00 PM EST DECEMBER 2, 2020. 
The image is apparently a reference to an Australian Defence Force report, released publicly this month, on unlawful killings in the Afghanistan war. Unlike in China, Australia’s government and military are accountable to the public, the press and the courts. Beijing has sought to torment Australia since the country called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic in April.
Yet economic warfare is a greater threat than taunts from China’s “wolf-warrior” diplomats. China has more than 50 times Australia’s population and accounts for nearly 40% of its exports. With tariffs and trade harassment, Beijing wants to signal that it can inflict economic ruin if Australia doesn’t bend the knee on issues like Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Huawei. 
Shanghai customs officials recently blocked the import of 20 tons of Australian rock lobster for days. The next target might be Australian iron ore, though so far that has proven too valuable to Chinese industry.
As the Asia scholars Charles Edel and John Lee have noted, the U.S. and Australia face different problems from China’s mercantilism. The U.S. has been hit by China’s technology theft, whereas Australia depends more on China’s consumption of raw materials.
Yet the U.S. shares an interest in helping Canberra resist Beijing’s extortion. China is trying to rewrite the rules of economic development in the Pacific. It wants to condition access to its economy on submission to China’s increasingly authoritarian political system, including limits on criticism from abroad.
If Australia can demand trade and diplomatic relationships based on equality, then so can nations like the Philippines and Indonesia. If it can’t, then China will draw more nations closer to its orbit, and the Pacific balance of power will drift away from the U.S.
 Joe Biden and his team have emphasized the importance of alliances to U.S. interests. One major question is if by this they mostly mean reverting to Obama -era relationships with Germany and the European Union, or if they also will do what is needed to balance China in its neighborhood. Australia is a key partner in the region, though Biden envoy John Kerry may see it as a climate delinquent.
In Australia, moderate views on China have diminished quickly, even among business interests, as Beijing’s bullying grows more brazen. The same is happening in the U.S., and the trend will continue if China doesn’t change course.

2020/11/30,Trump’s March to Atlanta,Main Street,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-march-to-atlanta-11606776426,"Donald Trump’s name isn’t on the Jan. 5 runoff ballot for Georgia’s two Senate races. But no one has a greater interest than the president in seeing Republicans take at least one of these seats—and keep their majority in the U.S. Senate. 
Because the first thing Democrats plan to do come January is start erasing Mr. Trump’s legacy. Absent a Republican Senate, there will be little to stop whatever appointments Mr. Biden may make or whatever legislative agenda he pushes through.
The two Georgia Republicans running are Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. They are being challenged, respectively, by Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. Given that the last Peach State Democrat elected to the Senate was Zell Miller in 2000, Republicans might in a normal year be expected to win fairly handily.
Then again, 2020 is not a normal year.
With the president’s lawyers still contesting the Georgia election results, a split has opened in Republican ranks. On Thanksgiving the president called the Georgia Republican who certifies those results, Secretary of State Brian Raffensperger, an “enemy of the people.” On Sunday he followed up by saying he was “ashamed” he’d ever endorsed Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. 
Attacks on fellow Republicans are nothing new for President Trump. The danger this time, however, is that they will sour the nearly 2.5 million Georgians who voted for him on the Republican Party, discouraging them from coming out in January to vote for its two candidates. Unfortunately, this is precisely what one of the president’s lawyers, Lin Wood, has urged Georgia’s Trump supporters to do. “Threaten to withhold your votes & money,” he wrote on Twitter, unless Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue do more to fix the “steal of the 11/3 GA election.”
Mr. Trump, by contrast, seems to appreciate that a defeat for these two Republicans would be a defeat for himself. Two weeks ago he tweeted, “I strongly stand with Kelly & David. They are both great and MUST WIN!” The day after Thanksgiving, he reiterated his claim that Joe Biden’s victory is a “total scam” but added that “we must get out and help David and Kelly, two GREAT people. Otherwise we are playing right into the hands of some very sick people. I will be in Georgia on Saturday!” 
 Donald Trump Jr. clearly intends to make himself felt in Georgia as well. A week ago he tweeted that it was “NONSENSE” for “people that are supposed to be on our side” to be “telling GOP voters not to go out and vote for @KLoeffler and @PerdueSenate.” On Monday Mr. Trump Jr. backed up his words with the launch of the Save the U.S. Senate super PAC, which will run ads in Georgia encouraging Trump voters to back the Republicans on Jan. 5.
In the meantime, Mr. Trump will be in Georgia Saturday because he knows the outcomes of these runoff races will help determine the fate of the Biden presidency. A Republican Senate wouldn’t only nix Mr. Biden’s more ambitious spending plans—e.g., a big fat climate package—but also create an incentive for Mr. Biden to reach deals by nominating more moderate judges and executive branch officials. Some even speculate Mr. Biden would prefer a Republican Senate as a card he could play against the party’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wing when it pushes him too far.
Mr. Trump’s interest in a Republican Senate is more fundamental. Over the past four years he has built a solid legacy of achievement—cutting taxes, deregulating the economy, appointing good judges to the federal bench, getting three of his nominees seated on the Supreme Court and so on. These are all things Democrats have vowed to reverse, and many have said that if they’re unable to do it by ordinary legislation, they’ll resort to radical measures such as abolishing the filibuster, packing the Supreme Court, and admitting new (Democratic) states to the union.
These also happen to be things that would be hard to get through a Senate run by Mitch McConnell. He wouldn’t be able to block everything. But he would be in a position to stop the worst, and in so doing, preserve many of Mr. Trump’s most significant achievements.
All this explains why the Georgia runoffs are rightly being treated as a second presidential election. As much as the outcome will affect Mr. Biden’s future, what Mr. Trump does in Georgia will also give us an insight about how he intends to use his influence going forward. If the goal is to run again in 2024, surely working for Republican victories in Georgia and elsewhere opens a more promising path than spending the next four years in Hillary Clinton -style loser mode.
As Mr. Trump admitted to reporters on Thanksgiving, it’s going to be “a very hard thing” for him to concede. But Georgia’s Senate runoffs offer him a twofer. Not only would Republican victories in Georgia help prevent the Biden administration from reversing his achievements; they also offer him the opportunity to go out on a winning note.
Mr. Biden and the Democrats campaigned on a clear theme: We’re the anti-Trump party, and when we get power our goal will be to undo everything he did. Right now Mitch McConnell is their most formidable obstacle. And keeping him Senate majority leader is President Trump’s best bet for preserving his own legacy.

2020/11/30,Germany Won’t Take Portugal’s EU Split,Global View,https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-wont-take-portugals-eu-split-11606776321,"As European diplomats haggled over the threatened Polish and Hungarian vetoes that could block the Covid bailout plan so laboriously negotiated earlier in the year, Portugal’s Socialist Prime Minister António Costa took the occasion to propose a plan to shrink and simplify the European Union. 
To make Europe work, he says, the countries that genuinely care about European values need to slough off the unbelievers. The remnant would be a smaller but purer group of countries ready to build the kind of “ever deeper union” of which EU founders like Jean Monnet and Robert Schumann dreamed. As Mr. Costa puts it, “Basically, it is whether the European Union is a union of values, or whether, on the contrary, it is primarily an economic instrument to generate economic value.” 
It is a noble-sounding idea, but it is not exactly correct. Under Mr. Costa’s proposed strategy, the EU might or might not become a “union of values.” But it would become a much more efficient economic instrument to transfer economic resources to Mr. Costa’s constituents. 
Mr. Costa, whose thinking about Europe is said to be close to that of French President Emmanuel Macron, has two groups of countries in mind when he speaks of the backsliders who fail to embrace European values. One group, the “Illiberal East,” as we can call them, are countries like Poland and Hungary that dissent from conventional EU orthodoxy on topics ranging from migration to gay rights—and whose governments have been widely criticized in Europe and beyond for undermining democracy through restrictive media laws and other stratagems. 
The other basket of deplorables Mr. Costa wants to toss is perhaps more surprising: the so-called Frugal Four (the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria and Sweden), which want to hold the lid on EU spending and don’t like Brussels-funded bailouts. Mr. Costa tries to draw a parallel between the Frugal Four’s alleged disregard of the core European value of solidarity with the Illiberals’ disregard of democracy and rule of law.
Cynics will note here that countries that Mr. Costa wishes to reject have another feature in common: They stand between Portugal and money. The ex-Warsaw Pact countries in the East are the chief rivals for EU funds to the Club Med countries of the South, and the Frugal Four are the tightwads who want to keep Brussels spending low—and to attach all kinds of irritating conditionalities to any bailouts. 
One can’t blame Mr. Costa for wrapping an ambition so practical in rhetoric so grand; a large part of political leadership involves the development of elevated political language for humdrum and sometimes even sordid goals. When you are a socialist, and you have—as Margaret Thatcher warned that you would—run out of other people’s money, words like “solidarity” and “values” come naturally to mind. 
France, which has long supported the idea of a smaller, tighter European core, will be happy with this approach—a win for Mr. Costa, who needs Paris’s support if (as is rumored) he nurses ambitions for a senior policy-making role in Brussels. But Mr. Costa’s speech is unlikely to have much impact where it really matters: Berlin. 
Germany likes the EU as it is. The divisions between the Frugal Four, Club Med and the Illiberal East help give Berlin the deciding vote in European affairs—and German political, economic and security interests all point to keeping the EU membership as is. Germans can see the traps Messrs. Costa and Macron are somewhat transparently constructing, and neither Angela Merkel nor any of her potential successors have the slightest intention of stepping into them. 
Europe’s biggest headache isn’t Mr. Costa’s call for fundamental change. It isn’t the constant French scheming. It isn’t even the imbroglio over Polish and Hungarian resistance to the legislation needed to complete the EU-funded Covid bailout. It’s ultimately the belief of so many Europeans that their countries can indefinitely embrace a policy of “values” which somehow always seems to involve transfers of resources from productive to less productive actors in the economy. 
Mr. Costa and his fellow Europeans aren’t wrong to care about social spending or the needs of the poor. They aren’t even wrong to point out that doctrinaire versions of laissez-faire policies often fall short in the real world. But where they do go seriously and grievously wrong is in forgetting that economic value is the value on which the others ultimately depend. A Europe that fails to excel economically cannot excel socially. The Frugal Four aren’t infallible when it comes to policy choices, but they aren’t betraying Europe when they talk about responsible budgeting and conditionality. They are trying to save it.

2020/11/30,Ancient History Isn’t Colonialism,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/ancient-history-isnt-colonialism-11606776241,"Is there room for ancient history in the Ivy League? A group called Decolonization at Brown doesn’t think so. It demands the university tear down statues of two Roman emperors, Caesar Augustus and Marcus Aurelius, on the ground that they “celebrate ongoing colonialism in the United States and idealize white, Western civilization—both of which continue to cause harm at Brown today,” as four of the decolonizers put it in an op-ed for the student newspaper, the Brown Daily Herald.
That’s nonsense. White supremacy didn’t emerge until the 17th century, when modern science gave rise to theories about human races. The emperors’ legacies represent some of civilization’s greatest virtues. 
And the Roman Empire had little in common with modern colonial ones. Caesar Augustus, the first Roman emperor, established the Pax Romana, a two-century period of peace and stability among the people of the empire. That peace was assured through conquest, but Roman subjects were citizens with all the rights and duties that it entailed, unlike in modern colonialism. He guaranteed that the government’s ultimate power rested with the Roman Senate, the legislative assemblies and executive magistrates. “When the dictatorship was offered to me, both in my presence and my absence, by the people and senate,” he wrote, “I did not accept it.” These actions find modern echoes in the postwar (and anticolonialist) Pax Americana and the U.S. Constitution’s checks and balances.
Marcus Aurelius was known for philosophical works that drew on his leadership experience. His writings encourage living in the present, nonjudgment and self-control. His best-known book is “Meditations,” a founding text of Stoic philosophy. Its ideas gave rise to virtue ethics, a normative theory that stresses wisdom, courage, justice and temperance. 
Marcus was also a skilled warrior and military commander, leading the Roman Empire to many victories against Germanic tribes. The Romans saw these white Northern Europeans as physically strong warriors but culturally inferior, with their brutish and violent manners—much as white colonizers millennia later would regard their subjects. 
Not everyone at Brown wants to tear the statues down. “Engaging in debate on the meaning of the statues is an important conversation,” says historian Dietrich Nuemann, “but removing them deprives us of that conversation.”
“Students are afraid of expressing themselves to keep the statues,” Nidhi Bhaskar, 21, an archaeology and public-policy major, told me. “Only online on anonymous forums students feel that they can express their sentiments freely.”
In her own op-ed for the Herald, she urged the university to uphold “the tenets of free inquiry and the preservation of nuance within the exploration of historical relics.” Or, as Marcus Aurelius put it, “The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”

2020/11/30,Biden’s Blind Spot,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-blind-spot-11606775954,"Voters are still waiting for the candidate who promised to be a president for all Americans to name an economic adviser who prioritizes the growth of the American economy. The emerging Biden team is heavy on academics and activists but light on market experience.
Expected Treasury secretary nominee Janet Yellen has spent a career in academia and government urging more of the latter. Today brings more news on appointments, but good luck spotting the growth advocates. The Journal’s Ken Thomas and Kate Davidson report on the Biden team, according to people familiar with his plans:
Former Hillary Clinton aide Ms. Tanden is catching heat from extreme leftists because last year an affiliate of her organization published a humorous video showing that after Vermont’s socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders became wealthy, he stopped attacking “millionaires” like himself and instead focused his fire on “billionaires.” 
But the leftists should understand that Ms. Tanden doesn’t have a problem with big government; she’s just an aggressive partisan. On this last point, her leftist critics should get more comfortable when they realize she was talking about “resistance” to Donald Trump as early as a November 2016 interview with National Journal. And as recently as three months ago she was still clinging bitterly to the Russia collusion fraud.
As for Ms. Rouse, the Journal reports that she’s “known for a 1997 paper on discrimination, in which she and her co-author, Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, found that female musicians were several times more likely to be hired by an orchestra when the auditions were ‘blind,’ and musicians performed behind a curtain.”
“Blind Spots in the ‘Blind Audition’ Study” was the headline last year on a Journal op-ed by Christina Hoff Sommers. She described the celebrated paper co-authored by Ms. Rouse:
Perhaps not surprisingly, an economic team notable for its activism shares a common view that more politics in the allocation of society’s resources is the key to prosperity. Mr. Thomas and Ms. Davidson report:
Ms. Davidson also reports along with Andrew Restuccia and Nick Timiraos on another expected hire:
Leftists won’t like that he spent some time on Wall Street, but they should feel better when they learn he worked in “sustainable investing” and that his government service was not about open energy markets. According to the Journal report: 
Instead of trying to find employees palatable to so-called progressives, perhaps Mr. Biden should add to his economic team someone who prioritizes economic growth. The former vice president might be surprised at how many voters would welcome such an appointment. Analyzing the polling errors that have occurred “in every election this century,” Scott Rasmussen writes in the Deseret News:
Perhaps some of these political elites aren’t recognizing the error because they receive news from organizations where capitalism’s critics are more than adequately represented. At the New York Sun Ira Stoll finds no shortage of recent New York Times stories questioning the results of market economies:

This Boot’s Been Made for Biden
You kept playin’ with some big playful puppy
Someone you could call to stay and fetch
But you’ve been a’playin’ how you shouldn’t ‘ve been a’playin’
And now your ankle’s stretched a painful stretch
Well, this boot’s been made for Biden, and that’s just how you’ll be shod
One of the ways inauguration’s gonna look real odd.

2020/11/30,How Biden Can Break the Senate Stonewall,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-biden-can-break-the-senate-stonewall-11606776086,"When the election was called for President-elect Joe Biden, progressives across the nation breathed a sigh of relief. But as the congressional results became clear, many of us paused the celebration. Unless Democrats win both Georgia Senate seats in Jan. 5 runoffs, Mr. Biden will be the first Democrat to face a Republican Senate at the beginning of his first term since Grover Cleveland in 1885. How can he even hope to pursue a progressive agenda?
The concern is well-founded because continued gridlock would be a disaster, blocking America from working through its challenges. But there is a way forward. Pundits are prone to parse the electorate between red and blue, but voters are much more complex. Millions who cast their ballots for Mr. Biden or President Trump support policy positions held by the other candidate. That isn’t to argue that President Biden should walk away from his agenda and put his finger in the wind. But it does suggest that, while Republican senators may profess to oppose the Democratic agenda, on particular issues, they’re poised to join a “coalition of the willing.”
Voters are more complex and less partisan than is commonly appreciated. More than a third describe themselves as independents. In ballot measures this November, various Trump states embraced progressive priorities—and Biden states turned right as well. In Florida, where Mr. Trump won by more than 350,000 votes, more than 60% of voters approved a ballot initiative raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Mr. Biden won California 64% to 34%, but a ban on affirmative action was upheld 57% to 43%. South Dakota voted 54% to 46% to legalize marijuana, but supported Mr. Trump. Illinois, which gave Mr. Biden a 16-point margin, voted down a progressive income tax. Three months after voting for Medicaid expansion, Missouri went for Mr. Trump. And previously red Arizona, which Mr. Biden won by a hair, approved an income tax hike on those making more than $250,000 to fund the state’s schools.
Because these ballot measures weren’t connected to candidate personalities or any larger narrative, they offer an unvarnished view of what people really believe and a window into how to lead during a period of divided government. No Democrats and very few Republicans want to replace Trump-era vitriol with Biden-era bickering, and that should inform the way Democrats at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue think about their legislative strategy. With the filibuster still in place, progressives will have no way of forcing controversial legislation through the Senate, regardless of what happens in Georgia. So the White House will need to gain the acquiescence of at least a handful of Republican senators to drive progress.
One strategy is to try to beat moderate Republicans into submission, dreaming that a deluge of angry phone calls, emails and social-media posts will cow them into supporting a progressive agenda. While that may be emotionally gratifying, it’s rarely effective. A more promising approach would be to find issues on which individual senators would benefit politically from breaking with their leadership and supporting President Biden’s plan. That would allow for small compromises that build the trust needed to advance bigger legislative priorities later.
The minimum wage would be a good start—if only because, as the results from Florida reveal, millions of Republican voters would support raising the federal floor for the first time since 2007. In the House, an up-or-down vote would almost surely pull GOP support. That would then put pressure on the Senate, where Republican members up for re-election in 2022 would have reason to jump on board. It would be an auspicious start.
Next, the White House should look to executive actions that can spur legislative action. With a stroke of a pen, President Biden will be able to undo some of the damage Mr. Trump has done on immigration—most notably to the Dreamers brought to America as small children who remain at risk of being deported. And once Mr. Biden has pushed as far as he can go with executive action, he can push Congress to enshrine that policy in federal law. That playbook can be applied across a range of issues where Republican legislators may have reason to engage.
The same goes for the environment. Trump voters may recoil at the phrase “Green New Deal,” but many Republicans support clean water and air. The Biden administration could strengthen fuel-economy standards on its own, then turn to Congress to create new incentives for renewable energy. Likewise, Republican legislators may resist “Medicare for All,” but many want to make prescription drugs more affordable and end surprise medical billing. Lawmakers can also build on bipartisan progress on criminal-justice reform and find opportunities to improve support for ex-convicts re-entering society. Some activists would see these smaller victories as inconsequential. But these reforms would make a difference in the lives of ordinary people, and that would help build political momentum for bigger changes.
The core challenge for Democrats is to prevent Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell from approaching the Biden administration with the same obstinacy he used to stifle President Obama’s agenda, with mixed success. To make Mr. Biden a single-term president, Mr. McConnell would need to hold his caucus in lockstep. Democrats can counter by showing that they’re capable of building a “coalition of the willing” one issue at a time.
Mr. Emanuel was a senior adviser to President Clinton and chief of staff to President Obama. He represented Illinois’s Fifth Congressional District, 2003-09, and served as mayor of Chicago, 2011-19.

2020/11/30,Biden Brings Traditional Values to Diplomacy,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-brings-traditional-values-to-diplomacy-11606774757,"Your editorial “Biden’s Liberal Internationalists” (Nov. 24) points out that Joe Biden’s choices for national security posts and his selection of John Kerry to be a cabinet-level special envoy for climate all signal that the new governing team will work on behalf of U.S. interests through multilateral institutions. President Trump’s go-it-alone approach will be a bad memory, as America heads back to the future with a Biden-Harris reboot of Obama-Biden international agreements and alliances.
General Motors read the Biden climate-change forecast and announced that it no longer will back the Trump administration in its legal battle to prevent California from implementing its own fuel-efficiency standards that are stricter than federal rules. California’s probable (unofficial) takeover of national fuel standards under the new climate regime in Washington is apropos. Postelection commentary that celebrates the outcome as a win for moderation rarely mentions that California’s voters accounted for the bulk of Mr. Biden’s winning popular-vote margin. In fact, California and its two left-coast partners, Oregon and Washington, delivered about 6.3 million more popular votes as well as 74 Electoral College votes to Mr. Biden. Absent the left coast, he lost the 47-state popular vote by a couple hundred thousand.
Today, what is good for California is good for the country and GM and the liberal world order and the Paris climate accord and, as you note in your editorial, terrific for China.
Pat Walsh
Charleston, S.C.
Joe Biden’s experience isn’t a cause for reassurance when he has been on the wrong side of every major foreign policy decision of the last 40 years. Is Tony Blinken’s support for the Libya intervention supposed to give us confidence in the return of “competence?” The effect of the intervention in Libya has been to foment civil war, destabilize the Sahel, motivate massive illegal immigration flows to Europe, give Russia and Turkey major new influence in a vital part of the world and provide ISIS with a new haven. The foreign-policy establishment also brought us NATO expansion to Russia’s doorstep, Somalia and a 19-year campaign to turn Afghanistan into Switzerland. How many more of these policy “success stories” can we survive? 
How will a return to wishful thinking and misplaced faith in multilateral institutions serve our actual interests in a world that has been returning to a landscape of great power competition for over a decade? No doubt a resumption of “business as usual” will be a welcome relief to those (putative allies as well as adversaries) who derive great benefits with no responsibility under the international system the establishment continues to be wedded to.

Internationalism a liberal tenet? How quickly President Trump’s lackeys forget names like Kissinger and McCain. President Reagan’s foreign policy, while hawkish and featuring a military buildup to escalate the Cold War, was grounded in internationalism—stemming the tide of communism to build alliances and advocating for American values abroad.

Mr. Biden is surrounding himself with “old hands” from the Clinton and Obama administrations, but there isn’t one of them who is particularly distinguished. They are reliable and steady, and it makes me think more of an interregnum than an administration with a fresh face and new ideas. Is this by design? Whom are we waiting for? I believe with these picks Mr. Biden has already weakened himself.

2020/11/30,Remediating Student Debt’s Failing Grades,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/remediating-student-debts-failing-grades-11606774629,"The expected taxpayer losses on student-loan debt highlight the disastrous consequence of shielding the higher-education industry from the loan losses incurred for its services (“U.S. Faces $400 Billion Student-Loan Loss,” Page One, Nov. 23). Because these risks are borne by the taxpayer, colleges raise prices confident that government loan guarantees will facilitate student borrowing to pay the increased costs.
If student loans were guaranteed by the colleges themselves, either individually or by a cooperative arrangement, loan-performance risk will be borne by the entities that benefit directly from the proceeds. This approach would give colleges strong incentives to determine whether the borrower likely will repay the debt with the education to be received, whether the college-cost structure aligns with the demand for the services of its graduates, and whether the college prepares students for real-world success after graduation.
Max Toch
Vienna, Va.
Rarely is the interest rate on student loans discussed. My daughter’s loans are 6% annually. In this environment that rate is usurious. To help resolve the student-loan issue I suggest that interest on outstanding student loans should immediately be reduced to 1% or less, approximately the yield on a 10-year Treasury note. Each current loan balance should be credited for the total interest accrued at a rate greater than 1% over the life of the loan. If the interest credit is equal to or exceeds the loan balance, the loan is considered retired, period. There should be no tax consequences as the principle was repaid and only excessive interest is being written off. It is reasonable that our government shouldn’t charge an excessive interest rate or make a profit on loans for education.
Darrell Fisk
Federal Way, Wash.

Regarding Beth Akers’s “Forgive Student Loans, but Only a Little” (op-ed, Nov 23): The focus is always on cleaning up the mess, while ignoring the continuing mess-making. The solution always ensures making more messes. Debt jubilee pushers should be dissecting the problem’s causes, not trying to sell us a Band-Aid. We need to appreciate the moral hazard caused by wholesale forgiveness and recognize the infighting among different borrower classes that a jubilee creates. Set your sights on university endowments, which have grown alongside the loan problem.

2020/11/30,Assassinations and Iran’s Nuclear Program,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/assassinations-and-irans-nuclear-program-11606774551,"Your editorial “Biden, Iran and the Bomb” (Nov. 28) is shameful in its inhumanity. The unjustifiable support for a brutal assassination of a prominent scientist does nothing more than encourage a few criminals, such as the Israeli regime and its allies, to commit more assassinations. The assassination of an official of a U.N. member state in its territory is a dangerous game, opening a Pandora’s box; one whose consequences only reckless, apocalyptic people would ignore. Undoubtedly, the Israeli regime’s involvement in this criminal act is designed to further disrupt the turbulent situation in the region and destroy the path for diplomacy.
Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was an eminent scientist and national hero for all Iranians. His last service to the country was the production of a coronavirus diagnostic kit, as well as the management of a project to produce an Iranian Covid vaccine—one that had reached the human-testing stage. Assassinating him will do nothing to Iran’s completely peaceful nuclear program, as the assassinations of our nuclear scientists in the past few years have not affected the advancement in our peaceful nuclear activities.

2020/11/30,ESG Investment Judgments Are Rooted in the Search for Value,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/esg-investment-judgments-are-rooted-in-the-search-for-value-11606774389,"The editorial “Labor vs. the ESG Racket” (Nov. 15) that targets the examination of investment opportunities through an environmental, social and governance lens seems to misunderstand what we as asset managers aim to achieve on behalf of investors. This conversation is relevant to a new rule from the U.S. Department of Labor that discourages ESG investment options in America’s private sector retirement plans.
The last few decades have shown us that stock markets are quite efficient, as evidenced by the challenges active managers have in beating benchmarks consistently. As for ESG factors—such as measuring things like supply chain resilience or protection of company data—there is sufficient evidence from numerous and varied studies linking these factors with longer term corporate and investment performance to conclude that these are worthy of consideration.
The choice to either deliberately ignore the materiality of ESG factors and disregard them as a source of performance, or to expect to have the ability to prove their financial efficacy beyond any doubt, is inconsistent with the natural pursuit of excellence in investing. Asset managers, as fiduciaries, must continue to have a broad lens when making investment decisions. Judgments on ESG factors are rooted in the hunt for value, not values, with the best interest of the investor paramount. 
Let the marketplace determine the value of research and results arising in asset management. The degree of scrutiny from investors and their agents and the high level of transparency afforded to investors will continue to drive a healthy and competitive market.
