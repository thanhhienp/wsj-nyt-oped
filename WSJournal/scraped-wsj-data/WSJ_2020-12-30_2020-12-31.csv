2020/12/30,Trump’s Embarrassing Electoral College Hustle,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-embarrassing-electoral-college-hustle-11609371708,"President Trump’s last and worst shot at overturning the 2020 election will come on Jan. 6, as the new Congress meets in joint session to tally the votes from the Electoral College. Mr. Trump wants Republican lawmakers to lodge formal objections to Joe Biden’s electors, and this kamikaze mission already has a few volunteers.
Here’s what would happen next, at least according to the Electoral Count Act: If a state’s electors are challenged by both a Senator and a Representative, then each chamber is supposed to retire to consider it. If they rejected the electors of enough states to deny Mr. Biden 270 electoral votes, then the House would choose the President.
But how could lawmakers justify throwing out electors for Mr. Biden? Although Mr. Trump keeps tweeting claims of massive vote fraud, his lawsuits have been rejected in court, sometimes by his own conservative appointees.
Any challenge to Mr. Biden’s electors appears doomed, since upholding the objection takes a majority in both chambers. The Democratic House would use the opportunity to excoriate Mr. Trump a final time on his way out the door, and grown-ups in the Republican Senate are unlikely to play along. Hence the Trump crowd’s latest argument: that the power to invalidate electors rests with the joint session’s presiding officer—Vice President Mike Pence. 
A nub of truth here is that the Electoral Count Act might be unconstitutional. Originally passed after the contested-election mess of 1876, it purports to let a simple majority of Congress decide which presidential electors are valid, a power that’s hard to justify under the Constitution or separation-of-power principles. 
Reverting to the Constitution’s text, however, would be small help to Mr. Trump. The workings of the Electoral College were refined by the 12th Amendment, which says that the Vice President shall “open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.” Where does that language give Mr. Pence unilateral authority to set aside electors? This can’t be what the Founders wanted. 
In 1876, at least, there were competing electors that each claimed official imprimatur. In Oregon the Governor and the Secretary of State certified different slates. Florida’s outgoing Governor signed off on a group of electors, only to be reversed by the incoming Governor.
None of that ambiguity exists now. Self-styled Republican shadow electors held their own gatherings this month in some states that Mr. Biden won. But it was a purely extracurricular exercise. In Georgia the GOP chairman said it was intended to preserve Mr. Trump’s legal options, even as the state’s Republican leaders officially certified electors for Mr. Biden.
If Democrats tried a similar Electoral College stunt, Republicans would hoot it down. The closest recent analogue was after the 2004 race, when Democrats challenged Ohio’s electors, claiming they wanted to force a debate on voting reforms. Sen. Barbara Boxer joined them, delaying the ratification for hours as the House and Senate considered the objections.
 Rep. Nancy Pelosi defended the exercise, saying that the discussion “should not be considered frivolous.” Rep. Jerrold Nadler thundered that “the right to vote has been stolen from qualified voters,” while allowing that irregularities “have not been proved to have changed the outcome.” Rep. Maxine Waters charged that Ohio’s “partisan Secretary of State, Mr. Kenneth Blackwell, I’m ashamed to say an African-American man,” failed to pursue voter intimidation. 
What was the GOP’s rejoinder? “Some Democrats only want to gripe about counts, recounts, and recounts of recounts,” said Rep. Deborah Pryce. Then- Rep. Roy Blunt pointed to the substantial Ohio margin. “If we were taking this important time today to talk about a difference of 118 votes,” he said, “that might be justifiable,” but Mr. Bush won by 118,000. Then- Rep. Rob Portman dismissed “irresponsible conspiracy theories about what happened in Ohio,” adding: “I was there. It didn’t happen.”
Counts, recounts, and recounts of recounts—that’s a description of Georgia this year. The difference is that in 2004 Democratic candidate John Kerry conceded. “I will not be taking part in a formal protest of the Ohio electors,” he said. Despite reports of irregularities, “our legal teams on the ground have found no evidence that would change the outcome.” Does Mr. Trump want to depart by making people pine for the statesmanship of John Kerry?
Republicans should be embarrassed by Mr. Trump’s Electoral College hustle. Mr. Trump is putting his loyal VP in a terrible spot, and what do Republicans think would happen if Mr. Pence pulled the trigger, Mr. Biden was denied 270 electoral votes, and the House chose Mr. Trump as President? Riots in the streets would be the least of it.
Mr. Pence is too much of a patriot to go along, but the scramble to overturn the will of the voters tarnishes Mr. Trump’s legacy and undermines any designs he has on running in 2024. Republicans who humor him will be giving Democrats license to do the same in the future, and then it might matter.

2020/12/30,Trump’s School-Choice Relief,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-school-choice-relief-11609371551,"Democrats hate vouchers so much that they restricted states from using education funds in the $900 billion Covid relief bill to help struggling families during the pandemic send their kids to private schools. All the more credit to President Trump for opening the door for at least some school-choice relief.
The Covid-19 relief bill sets aside $2.75 billion for private K-12 schools on top of some $54.3 billion for public schools. The catch is that none of the private-school funds can be used for vouchers that go directly to families. States can use the funds to support prep schools attended by the children of Members of Congress, but not to help low-income kids attend those schools.
Democrats, er, unions, were angry after several Republican governors used their small pot of discretionary education money from the Cares Act to help low- and middle-income families struggling to afford private-school tuition. So they fought to stop governors from doing so again. Republicans surrendered because they didn’t want to hold up the bill.
On Monday Mr. Trump signed an executive order that helps remedy the injustice by allowing states and local agencies to draw from $1.7 billion in federal funds from the separate Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program to “provide emergency learning scholarships to disadvantaged families for use by any child without access to in-person learning.” 
States are supposed to allocate the grant money to groups that help low-income folks with employment, education and housing, among other things. Mr. Trump’s order says recipients can also use the grant funds for scholarships to assist families with private-school tuition and other education costs. 
The executive order cites a June McKinsey study projecting that Hispanic, black and low-income students would lose 9.2, 10.3 and 12.4 months of learning, respectively, if in-person classes didn’t fully resume before January 2021. It also found that the average K-12 student in the U.S. could lose $61,000 to $82,000 in lifetime earnings in that scenario.
Joe Biden could reverse Mr. Trump’s order, but he’ll have to explain why he wants to keep low-income families from in-person education that public schools refuse to provide despite getting tens of billions more in relief.

2020/12/30,"$2,000 Checks for the Affluent",Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/2-000-checks-for-the-affluent-11609371467," Donald Trump and Chuck Schumer keep demanding another $2,000 in relief checks for their own political reasons, but it looks like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may hold them off with some crafty political maneuvering. He’s also right on the policy merits.
 Mr. McConnell has linked the $2,000 checks to Mr. Trump’s other demands to repeal a liability shield for big tech firms and establish a commission to investigate voter fraud. Democrats don’t like the latter two provisions, so a bill with all three isn’t likely to pass the Senate. This betrays that Democrats are merely using the $2,000 checks to help the Democratic candidates in the Georgia Senate runoffs next week.
Mr. Schumer wants the Senate to pass the bill the House passed earlier this week with the $2,000 checks. The Senate Finance Committee staff has examined the details of both the House bill and Mr. Trump’s proposal, and it turns out they’re even worse than we thought in flowing to affluent Americans. 
The House bill would increase the $600 checks to $2,000 ($4,000 for joint tax filers) with another $2,000 for each dependent regardless of age. All told the House bill would provide benefits to a family of five making up to $350,000 a year. The cost would add $463.8 billion to the national debt in addition to the $165.7 billion in checks that passed Congress this month. In other words, Democrats want to burden future taxpayers to write even bigger checks to affluent families today.
Mr. Trump’s proposal is somewhat less spendthrift in leaving payments to children age 18 or younger at $600. But he would still provide benefits to a family of five earning up to $266,000 a year and add $315.5 billion to the debt.
Mr. McConnell called this “another fire hose of borrowed money that encompasses other people who are doing just fine.” The bill that has already passed Congress is better targeted at the unemployed and low-income workers with more cash, more food stamps, more child-care subsidies, and higher jobless benefits.
Even some Keynesian economists who aren’t entirely in the Democratic tank are opposing the $2,000 checks as poorly targeted and unneeded given the pace of economic recovery and vaccine deployment. The press loves the new Trump-Schumer condominium, but Mr. McConnell and Senate Republicans are better serving the country this year and into the future.

2020/12/30,Surprise! A Health Lobby Cage Match,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/surprise-a-health-lobby-cage-match-11609371346,"It will take months to digest everything in the Covid relief bill rammed through Congress and signed by President Trump over the weekend. Both parties are hailing an end to “surprise” medical billing, though a word about this cage match between doctors and insurers. 
Here’s what we mean by surprise billing: Say you have surgery at a hospital that participates in your insurance network. Unknown to you, the anesthesiologist who puts you under isn’t part of the network. Later this provider bills your insurer for her services, at high prices without a negotiated plan discount. Then the provider sticks you with whatever the insurer refuses to pay. Surprise!
Awful stories abound: a family billed $50,000 for a neonatal intensive care unit stay at a hospital in their insurance network. A 2019 analysis in JAMA Internal Medicine found that 39% of more than 13 million visits to an in-network emergency room between 2010 and 2016 ended in an out-of-network bill, frequently for services like radiology. 
Other evidence suggests the practice is concentrated among a small number of hospitals. A subset of physician staffing agencies seems to have figured out it can be lucrative to leave networks and bill patients directly—a nice little arbitrage game on an opaque, third-party payment system. No one with chest pains looks up his doctor network before dialing 911. 
Congress has debated intervention that would shield consumers from the damage by limiting them to paying their typical network cost-sharing. As for the rest of the charges, insurers favored a “benchmark” that would reimburse providers at the median rate of in-network services. This is government dictation of what providers can charge. Hospitals and doctors preferred arbitration that would allow a supposedly neutral party to divine the proper price of the service. In other words, both want to club the other with price controls. It’s a pity they couldn’t both lose. 
The deal in Congress tries to hold patients harmless for emergency care and some non-emergencies, and erects an arbitration process to settle payment fights. Health-care experts Doug Badger and Brian Blase have pointed out that arbitration, which we support in other contexts, exists for parties who have entered a contract. Here the doctor and insurer have declined to do so. Most distortions in health care derive from price setting in Medicare and Medicaid, and you can expect this political response to surprise billing to cause more surprise complications. 
Congress could have penalized insurers who advertise a facility as “in network” if many of the doctors aren’t, or put the onus on hospitals to align the doctors they employ with the insurance networks they join. It would have been better to stop at banning this form of billing patients—and tell hospital systems and insurers to sort out their own problems through the rough and tumble of negotiation. 
But both Republicans and Democrats were eager to claim credit for doing something, and the hope is that this will at least help some consumers who were collateral damage in a fight between doctors and insurers. A parting word to the private health industry: Begging government to resolve your internecine wars will make the public more sympathetic to a single-payer system that puts you out of business.

2020/12/30,How I Became a ‘Far-Right Radical’,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-i-became-a-far-right-radical-11609370135,"I’ve been put on a list and not a good one. It isn’t the Hollywood Reporter’s Next Gen Class of 2020 or Forbes’s 30 Under 30—forget the accolade; I’d take being under-30 again. That would be so much better for my career than where I am now: a comedian approaching 39, who finds his work labeled “far-right” in an academic paper titled “Evaluating the scale, growth, and origins of right-wing echo chambers on YouTube.”
Although I’m not mentioned by name, if you turn to the last page of the preprint paper—which has yet to be peer-reviewed or submitted to a journal—you’ll see the words “We the Internet TV” huddled among other supposedly far-right YouTube channels. I was head writer and producer of We the Internet TV before my position was eliminated in October. For five years I was responsible for making hundreds of videos about current events, politics and culture. I was an equal-opportunity offender. Our comedy channel made fun of everybody—left, right, center.
I remember the good old days of cancel culture, when if you landed a gig on “Saturday Night Live,” someone would have to put in some work to get you canceled. Before online mobs could be whipped up in seconds, an angry detractor would have to roll up his sleeves, comb through your tweets, listen to hours of your podcast, or track down a recording of you bombing at an open mic to find the material to take you down.
Don’t get me wrong: My “problematic” material is out there. But this study eliminates the need for a critic of mine to go put in the legwork of a keyword search. Researchers from prestigious institutions including the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard already went to the trouble of demonstrating that I am somehow responsible for “the phenomenon of right-wing radicalization on YouTube.” It’ll be easy to cancel any success I find in mainstream media.
Which videos did it? I wonder. Was it “Burglars for Gun Control” or “Your Gun Makes You Look Like a D—”? The videos lambasting the alt-right or the anti-antifa one? The sketches critical of President Obama’s drone strikes or the one mocking YouTube commenters leaving racist insults about the 44th president? 
I don’t know. I have never faced my accusers. I would like to scroll through the We the Internet TV library with them and point out the kind of “far-right” material that won us a Webby Award in 2017. Other winners that year included the Women’s March and CNN’s Van Jones. 
At first I found it odd that the words “fascism,” “racism” and “terrorism” were missing from the paper, because these terms have become inextricably linked to the far right. Then I realized it was a smart (and cowardly) move on the part of the authors to leave them out: just use the umbrella term “far right” and allow your readers to fill in the tacit isms. That way, you don’t risk being called out for labeling people who are not fascists, racists and terrorists as such. Instead, the study is peppered with nebulous adjectives like “extreme” and “radical,” which allow readers to see their own bogeymen. 
I’m not the only one who takes issue with being mislabeled. This gives me some hope for my future. 
In the study’s view, former Evergreen College professor Bret Weinstein —a self-described progressive and Bernie Sanders supporter—is far-right too. Joining us are neuroscientist Sam Harris (a self-confessed liberal), podcast host Joe Rogan (who considers himself “pretty liberal”) and Bloggingheads.tv (whose regular contributors include Vox co-founder Ezra Klein ). 
One thing that’s interesting—by which I mean bonkers—is that while Mr. Rogan’s channel is deemed far-right, the “Joe Rogan University—Fan Channel” is labeled “center.” Does Mr. Rogan’s podcast only radicalize casual watchers, but not his fans?
Even Mark Ledwich, whom the paper’s authors thank for sharing data with them, took issue with “the way the labels were converted into far-right and far-left.” (To wit: On his site Transparency.Tube, which tracks political channels on YouTube, We the Internet TV only scored “Right” and “Anti-woke.”) 
Lumping together all these creators with vastly different political persuasions is lazy at best. At worst it undermines criticism of actual far-right content. As YouTuber Rebel Wisdom put it, “if everything is far right, then nothing is.” He is of course also “far right” by the paper’s standards.
It’s the type of analysis you’d have to be living in an echo chamber to come up with. The authors write that “the growing appeal of radical content on YouTube may simply reflect a more general trend driven by a complicated combination of causes, both technological and sociological, that extend beyond the scope of the platform’s algorithms.” 
But the walls of their bubble must not have been adequately soundproofed, because the authors are revising their paper ahead of its official publication to include a new category: Intellectual Dark Web. This IDW category would include channels that are “Anti-Woke” or “Anti-Social-Justice-Warrior.” In the current labeling system, any channel labeled IDW automatically qualifies as far right.
I can’t speak for all those other “radical” YouTube channels. But when it came to We the Internet TV, its “growing appeal” had a lot to do with it being funny. I even dared to do the type of comedy that gets you put on lists.
Mr. Perez is a comedian and host of “The Lou Perez Podcast.”

2020/12/30,Could Garry Moore Have Made 2020 Wonderful?,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/could-garry-moore-have-made-2020-wonderful-11609369835,"Even Garry Moore, may his ever-sunny soul rest in peace, might be hard-pressed to come up with an upbeat way to frame this year.
Moore (1915-93) was an amiable, crew-cut, bowtie-wearing broadcaster during the early years of television. He was the host of the popular game shows “I’ve Got a Secret” and “To Tell the Truth,” and Americans liked his friendly manner so much that CBS gave him his own prime-time variety show.
In those years you could count the number of TV channels on one hand. Many families had only one set. Programs had to try to appeal to everyone in the household, and Moore’s cheery, nonconfrontational personality made him an ideal front man.
The signature feature on “The Garry Moore Show” was something he called “That Wonderful Year.” Each week, he would tell his nationwide audience how terrific a specific year in the 20th century had been. You couldn’t name a year that he didn’t think had been marvelous. 
Wearing a fedora and cupping a cigarette in his right hand, Moore would walk between stage-set streetlights. He seemed to be emulating Frank Sinatra’s “In the Wee Small Hours” record-album cover, but helpful-next-door-neighbor Garry Moore, the fellow who would lend you a rake, couldn’t really pull off ring-a-ding-ding. 
 Yet there he was, every week, beneath those Sinatra streetlights, and an off-camera choir of sweet-voiced singers would croon: “That wonderful year, we hope you’ll see, the past reappear like a memory . . .”
With that, Moore would begin his pitch: “That wonderful year! Jersey Joe Walcott knocked out Ezzard Charles. Ben Hogan won the Open Golf Championship. And Joe DiMaggio retired from baseball with five world records to his credit.” 
The big reveal would appear suddenly on a lamp post. “Yes,” Moore would say, “it was that wonderful year—1951!” 
What would follow was a long segment featuring re-enactments of sprightly moments from each splendid year. Nat King Cole might come onstage to sing a vintage hit; Carol Burnett might act in a scene from a Broadway show that had been big box-office. Garry Moore was able to turn any American year into a distillation of pure joy. Heck, he managed to devote one peppy segment, full of laughter and music, to 1929: the year the stock market crashed. But what on earth would he have done with 2020? 
Mr. Greene’s books include “Chevrolet Summers, Dairy Queen Nights.”

2020/12/30,Building Bridges to Help the Economy Through Covid,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/building-bridges-to-help-the-economy-through-covid-11609369746,"The year is almost gone—and 2020 won’t be missed. The future looks brighter thanks to some truly amazing scientific work, but a thoroughly vaccinated America is probably six to nine months away. To limit the damage while getting from here to there, we need to build two (figurative) bridges: a public-health bridge and an economic-relief bridge. The two make a natural pair because the economy won’t get back to normal until the pandemic is under control.
President Trump’s grudging signature on a relief bill allows us to start building roughly half of the necessary economic bridge. I say “roughly half” because the $900 billion that Congress appropriated is about 40% of the amount provided in the Cares Act in March. (Should the $600 checks be boosted to $2,000, the bridge will be longer.) The Federal Reserve also unveiled a series of emergency responses to the economic crisis back then. Those timely and effective actions helped get the economy through the third quarter of 2020 in surprisingly good shape. 
As the pandemic worsened and the main provisions of the Cares Act started to phase out over the summer, it became clear that we needed another economic relief package. Clear to everyone, that is, except Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his colleagues. They refused to budge until the virus was raging out of control, the economy was looking a bit shaky, and millions faced eviction at Christmas.
Incredibly, Republicans even tried to hamstring the Fed. What little medicine is left in its cabinet is mostly slow-acting—not the sort of thing that can give the economy a quick boost if needed. There’s one big exception, however: emergency lending. Yet Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin decided to make that harder, and some Republican senators then tried to make it impossible. 
In contrast, Congress has an abundance of fast-acting palliatives at its disposal—such as extended and enhanced unemployment benefits, food stamps and other grants to the needy, measures to stave off evictions and bankruptcies, and simply writing checks. Now that Mr. Trump has spared a minute from his busy golfing schedule to sign the bill, many of these remedies will be continued or restarted. 
This matters greatly. The sooner the economy gets back to full employment, the less we’ll need to worry about scarring from the deep recession. With a faster recovery, fewer workers will lose their jobs permanently or see their skills atrophy. Fewer firms will go bankrupt. Fewer state and local governments will see their finances ruined and their public services decimated. 
But it’s a gigantic economy, and $900 billion is unlikely to be enough. Fortunately, President-elect Joe Biden understands that.
A public-health bridge to the second half of 2021 is also essential. Sadly, its prospects look poor, among other reasons because of the way Mr. Trump and his administration have politicized the response to the pandemic. Yes, marvelous work by brilliant scientists and dedicated medical professionals has produced excellent vaccines far sooner than we had any right to expect. But apart from that phenomenal success, the country has done just about everything wrong in fighting Covid-19—including, most recently, fumbling the vaccine rollout.
And at horrific cost. More than 19 million Americans have now been infected, and about 340,000 have died. These numbers place us among the worst-performing nations on earth. As this is written, the latest data from Johns Hopkins rank the U.S. as eighth worst among 217 countries in Covid cases per capita (nestled between French Polynesia and Bahrain) and 14th worst in deaths per capita (between Bulgaria and Mexico). 
Our neighbors to the north put us to shame. Covid illnesses and deaths per million people (so far) are about 60,000 and 1,050 here, but only about 15,000 and 420 in Canada. Had we achieved Canadian numbers, more than 200,000 dead Americans would be alive today. Do Canadians have better genes? No. Just better government.
The much-needed public-health effort requires simple measures like masks, social distancing, testing, tracing—and, perhaps above all, responsible behavior. Yet Mr. Trump and his enablers seem determined to turn these straightforward measures into tests of political will. Mr. Biden will stop promoting that craziness, but not until Jan. 20.
Decades from now, historians will look with wonder at how Republicans disparaged wearing masks and social distancing as infringements on individual liberty. But long before that, millions more Americans will have fallen ill and hundreds of thousands will have died. For them, Jan. 20 will not come soon enough.

2020/12/30,2020 Hindsight and a Look Ahead,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/2020-hindsight-and-a-look-ahead-11609369459,"Let’s bid farewell to a horrible year by reviewing my 2020 predictions and offering prophecies for the coming year. 
Overall, I made 20 correct forecasts—nine incorrect and three are up in the air. 
What I got right: Mayor Pete Buttigieg won the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden secured the Democratic nomination, President Trump trailed in the popular vote and carried Florida and Ohio while attracting more African-American and Hispanic voters than in 2016. The presidential election came down to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, settled by a wider margin than Mr. Trump’s combined 77,736-vote edge in 2016. Mr. Biden took them by 257,025 votes and won the election. As forecast, Democrats kept the House but with a reduced margin.
There was a second U.S.-China trade deal—and it wasn’t comprehensive. Nor did China buy the $141.7 billion in American goods it promised; by November, Beijing had bought only $82 billion. 
Middle East refugee flows increased but were mostly contained within the region. Libya became more chaotic, and the Islamist threat in the sub-Sahara grew. Iran continued disrupting Iraq, but Iraq’s government appears more stable.
The New England Patriots didn’t make it to the American Football Conference title game—they lost in the first round to wild-card Tennessee—and the “Greek Freak,” Giannis Antetokounmpo, was the National Basketball Association’s most valuable player.
Now my 2020 prediction bloopers. Climate guesses were a mixed bag: As predicted, U.S. carbon emissions dropped, but mostly because of the unpredicted Covid-induced economic contraction, not innovation. Global recession forced Paris climate accord signatories (including China and India) to reduce CO2 emissions, the opposite of what I predicted. 
The Democratic convention took one ballot, not more. Iowa didn’t go Democratic in November. Because of Covid, there was recession instead of 2.3% growth, and jobs and wages didn’t increase for workers. No U.S.-U.K. trade agreement. The Ravens didn’t win Super Bowl LIV, and their quarterback, Lamar Jackson, wasn’t MVP.
Three predictions are unresolved. Special counsel John Durham’s investigation is pending. I stand by my forecast that the U.S. dominates the competition for medals at what are now the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. The question of who controls the Senate will be settled in Tuesday’s Georgia runoffs: I still believe Republicans retain a narrow majority. They better, since some of my new prognostications hinge on it.
So for 2021 predictions: Mr. Biden’s approval rating a year from now is at least the 51% he received in November because the economy grows at better than 3.5%. Mr. Trump doesn’t declare for president next year because he doesn’t want the personal financial-reporting and contribution limits that would impose, but he keeps all options open for 2024 so he’s kingmaker even if he doesn’t run again.
As a private citizen, Mr. Trump needs better lawyers than Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Lin Wood. The Manhattan district attorney and New York state attorney general will dog him over personal finances.
Republicans maneuver to define themselves with Mr. Trump out of the White house but still on Twitter. Mr. Biden’s traditional Democrats and his party’s socialist wing argue about policy, personnel and bipartisanship, but by year’s end Mr. Biden is still governing as a normal liberal.
At least two Biden cabinet nominees aren’t confirmed. No major tax increase or Green New Deal-type climate measure passes. The Supreme Court reins in several of the new administration’s regulatory actions. There’s bipartisan legislation on Covid, infrastructure and trade. Violent urban crime grows. By July there are at least four effective coronavirus vaccines used by more than half the country.
North Korea launches an advanced intercontinental ballistic missile or conducts another nuclear test. Iran ramps up its nuclear program. China offers a big emissions reduction for ending U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Mr. Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson strike that U.S.-U.K. trade deal. The West decides how to counter Chinese intellectual-property theft and foreign-aid manipulation through its Belt and Road Initiative. There’s less difference than expected between the Biden and Trump policies on the Mideast and China.
Alabama is crowned college-football champion. The Kansas City Chiefs win another Super Bowl, but Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers is NFL MVP. Peyton Manning, Charles Woodson and a receiver— Reggie Wayne, Torry Holt or Calvin Johnson —are inducted into the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. Taylor Swift’s “Folklore” album wins a Grammy and “The Crown” an Emmy. 
These are my guesses for 2021, but life often takes us by surprise. May 2021 do so less cruelly than this year did.

2020/12/30,The U.S. General Who Steered China Right,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-u-s-general-who-steered-china-right-11609369333,"Of my many international students at Cornell, those from China are among the most eager to take up driving in America. Partly this is due to the popularity of cars in China, the most rapidly motorizing nation on earth. But it’s also because traffic in China and the U.S. follows the same rule of the road. Vehicles in both countries drive on the right. Learn to drive here and you can drive there.
China didn’t always drive right; before World War II its traffic ran on the left. That changed at midnight on Dec. 31, 1945. As the new year dawned, traffic throughout the land shifted from one side to the other. It was the work of Gen. Albert Wedemeyer of the U.S. Army, whom President Franklin D. Roosevelt had tapped to replace Joseph Stilwell as commander of American forces in China. Wedemeyer’s move was intended, at least ostensibly, to reduce accidents on China’s roads, which were clogged by American jeeps and trucks. But he likely had an ulterior motive.
The Japanese occupation of China prompted Wedemeyer’s decision. By early 1945, imperial troops had been forced out of Burma and the Pacific islands. But two million remained in mainland Asia, mostly in southern China. To drive the Japanese out, Wedemeyer launched Operation Carbonado. It required the marshaling of two divisions of Chinese troops by air from Burma, then moving them 700 miles south from Chongqing to the coast in a convoy of American trucks.
But because the vehicles were driven on the “wrong” side of the road, traffic accidents ensued. After driver education campaigns failed, Wedemeyer proposed to Chiang Kai-shek that China’s rule of the road be inverted. The generalissimo agreed. So did most Chinese; the move-left tradition had the mark of British imperialism.
Wedemeyer ordered a publicity campaign in preparation. “Posters were placed on telephone poles and shop windows,” he recalled in his memoir, “showing diagrammatically how traffic would move.” 
But there was resistance. Editorials appeared in the local press “criticizing the idea of breaking an old Chinese tradition and urging the Generalissimo to reconsider.” Suspicious, Wedemeyer ordered an investigation. The source turned out to be the British Embassy, whose officials were convinced that Wedemeyer was preparing for an invasion of another sort—the sale of American automobiles.
They were probably right. The Japanese surrender on Sept. 2, 1945, mooted Carbonado. With U.S. Army vehicles soon to leave, there was no need to alter traffic across China. Yet the plan proceeded.
Why? Wedemeyer was a patriotic American, and he might well have had the U.S. automobile industry in mind. Changing China’s traffic would pave the way for American cars in a market long dominated by the British. Indeed, he recalled with pleasure the “thrilling experience of standing on the balcony of my tower apartment in the Cathay Hotel in Shanghai to watch the traffic at midnight change over to move along the right side of the road.”
It wasn’t until the 1980s that Detroit moved into China, and it was only possible because Mao chose to keep move-right traffic flow after 1949—the same pattern used by the Soviet Union. Today, China’s roads are flooded with Buicks, Teslas and Fords. That these—and all other vehicles—move on the right like those in Parsippany, N.J., or Peoria, Ill., is daily proof that America’s most universal export to China is not Hollywood or McDonald’s but simply the way that we drive.

2020/12/30,Legion of Gloom,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/legion-of-gloom-11609366535,"Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has soured on the idea of closing schools in response to Covid-19, amid overwhelming evidence of student harm and a lack of evidence of public benefit. But the destructive policy seems to have a new lease on life in politics. In a dreary Tuesday speech in Wilmington, Del., President-elect Joe Biden suggested that some schools should remain closed through April--and even longer if there is not another huge round of federal spending on education. 
Mr. Biden, discussing the period following his Jan. 20 inauguration, said:
Taxpayers may be even more depressed to learn they will now be asked to fund a Biden administration program to persuade people to ignore the message of the Biden presidential campaign. As candidates, Mr. Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, cast doubt on the safety of any vaccines approved by the Trump administration. On Tuesday, after modestly acknowledging “there’s a vaccination hesitancy in many communities,” Mr. Biden promised “a massive public education campaign to increase vaccine acceptance. We’ll do everything we can to show the vaccines are safe and critically important for one’s own health and that of their families and the communities.” 
He then promised to “ensure vaccinations are free of charge,” perhaps unaware of existing federal policy. Then Mr. Biden’s speech got a little more confusing when he said:
Sounds like someone’s bucking for a demotion. 
Mr. Biden’s remarks on the economy were also puzzling. “Our economy is poised to come back and come alive,” he said. Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 33.4% in the third quarter of this year, a historic rebound after the second quarter’s sharp decline amid the shutdowns. Most economists expect the current quarter won’t be so spectacular, but still expect strong growth in the neighborhood of 5%. 
With two vaccines approved—and more vaccines likely to be approved within weeks—the main problem may be that too many governors believed the Biden campaign’s message that the Trump administration would not be able to quickly approve safe and effective vaccines. The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed seems to be distributing vaccines faster than states and health care providers are prepared to administer them. 
These are early days and around the holidays there may be some lag in the reporting of data, so perhaps vaccinations have proceeded even faster than the nearly 2.6 million doses so far counted by the federal Centers for Disease Control. But when the virus struck in the spring, if anyone had said that by December the federal government would be distributing vaccines faster than care providers could inoculate patents, any reasonable person would have called that a rare Washington success. Most of the credit of course goes to the scientists at pharmaceutical companies who made it happen. Yet Mr. Biden is still acting as if he’s about to lead an effort to do the hard part. On Tuesday he said:
By all means, keep speaking to all the state and local officials who may not have been prepared for the possibility of a medical success. But the overheated rhetoric suggesting Mr. Biden’s about to lead some sort of Manhattan Project amounts to a PR campaign for new spending regardless of scientific progress. 
Meanwhile in the Senate, Mr. Biden’s onetime presidential campaign rival Sen. Bernie Sanders is singing an accompanying tune, making ridiculous economic comparisons to justify massive federal interventions. This week Mr. Sanders said, “The working class of this country today faces more economic desperation than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s.”
Unemployment in the 1930s soared to around 25%. Today it’s below 7%, clocking in at 6.7% in November. The U.S. unemployment rate has reached this level or higher at some point in every decade since the 1930s, including for the entire Obama-Biden first term. 
OK, gloomers.

2020/12/30,Everybody Wants Credit for the Covid Vaccine,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/everybody-wants-credit-for-the-covid-vaccine-11609360492," Graham T. Allison correctly highlights the importance of competitive private enterprise in developing Covid-19 vaccines (“Who Made the Vaccine Possible? Not WHO,” op-ed, Dec. 24) but glosses over the primary importance of publicly funded basic research. That is, research not motivated by practical applications and not conducted by private companies, but motivated by the simple goal of understanding how the natural world works and conducted largely in public institutions.
Second is the essential role of governments and public funding, not only to support the basic research, but also to provide the legal framework essential for a market economy. I don’t deny the crucial role of private enterprise from that point onward, but to conclude that pharmaceutical companies and Operation Warp Speed deserve the vast bulk of the credit for the development of the vaccines is a selective reading of how science works.
William Horns

Mr. Allison doesn’t take his analysis to its logical conclusion. The researchers who formulated the vaccine were in the right place at the right time, with funding guarantees and advance-purchase orders. While their task wasn’t trivial, it appears that tens of laboratories around the world have completed it successfully.
The game changer was Operation Warp Speed. Without it, we would be sitting here waiting for a vaccine announcement, and then wondering when production would start.
 Alfred Nobel endowed his chemistry prize for those who have “conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.” A Nobel Prize in Chemistry for President Trump may be in order.
David Lewis
The Villages, Fla.
I wonder if it occurred to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, after she received her Covid-19 vaccine, that without the animal spirits of capitalism, there wouldn’t have been a vaccine to take. And when Sen. Bernie Sanders got his vaccine, did he realize it was the fruit of the push from a president he vilifies and an economic system in which profit-seeking drives innovation? The economic system that these politicians support, run by central planner in Washington, couldn’t have completed this mission in time.
Don Sullivan
Venice, Fla.
Who made a vaccine possible? The 30,000 volunteers who took a chance and joined a trial before it was proved to be safe. I have seen little acknowledgment of our contribution.
Once the vaccine was shown to be effective, we volunteers thought we’d be “unblinded”—told whether we were given the vaccine or a placebo—so the placebo group could be given the vaccine it helped make possible.
We haven’t. The FDA wants to milk some more data from our bodies to learn something more about the vaccine’s long-term safety, and it is content to sacrifice our short-term safety to get it.

2020/12/30,Christmas Messages From the Editorial Page,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/christmas-messages-from-the-editorial-page-11609360414,"Thank you for republishing Vermont Royster’s 1949 editorial “In Hoc Anno Domini” (Dec. 24). It is so important, in our world threatened by critical theory and cancel culture, to understand where we came from and the importance of freedom and individual responsibility in delivering us from the “darkness” and “oppression.” Your courage in sharing Paul’s words to the Galatians is one reason that I’ve been a subscriber for more than 60 years.
William Beattie
Danbury, Conn.
I was struck by the ocean of difference in depth between neighboring opinion articles on Christmas Eve. Royster’s “In Hoc Anno Domini” ends by appealing to the best parts of human nature: “And so Paul, the apostle of the Son of Man, spoke to his brethren, the Galatians, the words he would have us remember afterward in each of the years of his Lord: Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.” 
Yet on the adjacent page, Phil Gramm and Mike Solon’s “In Defense of Scrooge, Whose Thrift Blessed the World” (op-ed) honors Scrooge and Marley and “the wealth accumulators of our own age.” It concludes that “Scrooge’s wealth accumulation would have benefited far more people than anything he gave to charity after his reclamation.” Wealth hoarding—not driven by one of the better parts of our nature—is only another form of the bondage that Royster warns against.

2020/12/30,Enough Lunchbag Letdown: Full Deductibility for Meals,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/enough-lunchbag-letdown-full-deductibility-for-meals-11609360287,"Your editorial “The Martini Lunch Tax Code” (Dec. 22) criticizes the temporary return of business meals to full deductibility as bad tax policy. To the contrary, small businesses depend on these meals to grow their businesses. Unable to rely on Super Bowl advertising or stadium sponsorships, they build relationships one by one.
Business meals were an easy target for regulators due to the abuse of the three-martini lunch. But that was resolved decades ago, even if the stigma persists. As a certified public accountant and tax attorney for small businesses, I can attest that the Internal Revenue Code now has substantiation rules for these expenses that are stricter than most other deductions.
The full deductibility of meals is fair tax policy. When Congress picks and chooses which legitimate expenses to allow, the system goes out of balance. The limitation of the deduction for business meals has always hit small businesses disproportionately. Full deductibility, even on a temporary basis, is a first step towards reinstating fairness between small and big business. The policy should be praised, not bludgeoned. In a post-Covid-19 environment, business meals will play an important role in the revitalization of small business.

2020/12/30,Thomas Has Led the Fight Against Chevron Deference,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/thomas-has-led-the-fight-against-chevron-deference-11609360210,"It is a mystery to me why Kimberley A. Strassel, usually so knowledgeable and careful to include relevant facts in her Potomac Watch column, overlooked Justice Clarence Thomas when considering whether the Supreme Court might be willing to “take appeals and clarify important matters of administrative law,” in particular the “limits of the famed Chevron doctrine” (“Biden’s Court Problem,” Dec. 18). Ms. Strassel notes that Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have expressed skepticism about that doctrine, that less is known about Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and that even Chief Justice John Roberts has been willing to narrow Chevron’s scope.
But she fails to mention that Justice Thomas has argued explicitly in his concurring opinion in Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency (2015) that Chevron deference is unconstitutional and urged the Court to re-examine it. Beginning in the 2014-15 term, Justice Thomas has been on something of a crusade to explain and to urge the court to confront the fact that, in Charles J. Cooper’s summary, “the basic principles of our Constitution’s separation of powers are incompatible with the system of bureaucratic rule that took root in the progressive era.”

2020/12/30,The Tyranny of Diversity,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tyranny-of-diversity-11609347729,"President-elect Biden promises “the single most diverse cabinet, based on race, color, based on gender, that has ever existed in the United States of America.” Diversity, and its brother-in-law Inclusivity, is at the center of progressive politics and of woke culture. But what is its true value?
Diversity is a serious plank in the platform for equality generally: equality, be it noted, not of opportunity but of result. Diversity—in universities, corporations, government, TV commercials—is in part a deliberate attempt to make amends for past injustices. The intention is to bring minority groups out from their positions of marginality into the center of institutions, politics and culture generally. 
Universities employ deans and associate provosts whose entire task is to foster diversity. One such person was recently hired “to realize an ideal Northwestern University where community members are challenged to engage differences as strengths in an environment that ensures equality of access, opportunity, participation and representation.” When I spoke to a friend who teaches at Northwestern about what seemed to me the emptiness and unnecessary expense of such a job, he corrected me, at least partly, by pointing out that without such an administrator for diversity the school might be denied federal funds for scientific and other projects. 
There’s nothing wrong with the idealistic yearning for equality unless it gets in the way of other important goals or goods. The ideal of promised equality under communism, for example, annihilated the ideal of personal liberty. The political philosopher Isaiah Berlin often wrote about the conflict that arises when two good qualities compete. Great goods, Berlin thought, sometimes cannot live together: “We are doomed to choose, and every choice may entail an irreparable loss.” Is diversity, in higher education and in politics, always the right choice?
In contemporary higher education, diversity competes with intellectual authority, based on scholarly and scientific accomplishment. These days, diversity is all but victorious and intellectual authority well in retreat. This leaves no one in a position to set or determine educational standards. University presidents, once educational leaders, now focus on fundraising and public relations. The heads of academic departments tend to accept their jobs not out of a desire for intellectual leadership but to reduce their teaching loads. Because of this want of intellectual authority, universities have now been on the slide for many years. 
In government, the value of diversity is often in conflict with the value of true merit, or of the real abilities of the people chosen to perform their jobs. Under identity politics, so much favored by the Democratic Party, diversity is the sine qua non. In choices for cabinet and subcabinet posts, under identity politics the desire for—some might say the tyranny of—diversity generally trumps past performance. Under the banner of diversity, the political version of affirmative action rules. To have, in Mr. Biden’s words, “the single most diverse cabinet . . . that has ever existed in the United States” is considered meritorious, something grand in itself. 
In the conflict between goods, it is always worth asking who is favored and who loses because of the good chosen. In higher education we have witnessed Harvard, in its desire for diversity, turn away large numbers of highly qualified Asian-American applicants for admission. In contests for awards and prizes, diversity, too, is often the primary factor. A friend recently told me that his grandson won a Marshall Scholarship, all the more remarkable, he noted, since the kid is a white male.
America has always been and remains a diverse country, composed of waves of immigrants seeking opportunities available nowhere else. If some groups have had to struggle to secure these opportunities, they have for the most part successfully done so. Those who oppose them are now rightly regarded as retrograde. Left to their own devices, and once freed of the harness of victim status that many of their leaders wish to bind them in, they are likely to go from strength to strength. Attempts to rig the system in their favor through the artificial arrangements that imposed diversity requires cannot ultimately help them attain the genuine equality that only true accomplishment can bring.
The best way to celebrate diversity, perhaps, is to begin by celebrating diversity of thought.

2020/12/30,Cold War With China Is Avoidable,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/cold-war-with-china-is-avoidable-11609347643,"American relations with China are at their lowest point in 50 years. Some say Donald Trump has bequeathed Joe Biden a new cold war, which they define as intense competition without shooting. But it is not yet a cold war, and Mr. Trump isn’t the sole source of the problem. 
In the past decade, Chinese leaders abandoned Deng Xiaoping’s moderate policy of biding their time. They became more assertive, building artificial islands in the South China Sea and coercing Australia economically. On trade, China tilted the playing field with subsidies to state-owned enterprises and forced intellectual-property transfer. Mr. Trump was clumsy in responding with tariffs on both allies and China, but he was correct to defend against Chinese companies like Huawei, whose plans to build 5G networks pose a security threat.
It is a mistake, however, to think we can decouple our economy completely from China without enormous economic costs. That is why the cold war metaphor is misleading. In the Cold War, the Soviet Union was a direct military and ideological threat to the U.S., and the two countries had almost no economic or social interdependence. The U.S. does half a trillion dollars in trade annually with China, not to mention the millions of social interchanges like tourism. China has learned to harness the creativity of markets to authoritarian Communist Party control in ways the Soviets never mastered. 
The U.S. and its allies aren’t threatened by the export of communism—few are taking to the streets in favor of Mr. Xi’s ideology—but by a hybrid system of economic and political interdependence that China can manipulate. More countries count China than the U.S. as their leading trade partner. Partial decoupling on security issues like Huawei is necessary, but total economic decoupling would be costly, and few allies would follow suit. 
Moreover, with regard to the ecological aspects of interdependence such as climate change and pandemics, the laws of physics and biology make decoupling impossible. No country can solve transnational problems alone. The politics of global interdependence involves using power with others as well as over others. For better and worse, we are locked in a “cooperative rivalry” with China in which we need a strategy that can accomplish two contradictory things at the same time. This isn’t like Cold War containment. 
Meeting the China challenge will require a more complex strategy that leverages American hard and soft power at home and abroad to defend ourselves and strengthen a rules-based system. Some pessimists look at China’s population size and economic growth rate and believe the task is impossible. On the contrary, if the U.S. treats allies as assets rather than liabilities, the combined wealth of the Western democracies will far exceed that of China well into this century. 
A successful challenge to China will require clear strategy with well-defined goals. It will require establishing and defending technology standards and values that are consistent with freedom. A new cold war can’t be ruled out. But as Henry Kissinger has warned, the appropriate historical metaphor today isn’t 1945 but 1914, when all the great powers expected a short third Balkan war. Instead they got a world war that lasted four years and destroyed four empires. A successful strategy must also protect against such a sleepwalker syndrome. 
If China thinks it can coerce Taiwan with a blockade or by taking an offshore island—or there is a ship or aircraft collision that leads to loss of life—all bets are off. If the U.S. reacts by freezing Chinese assets or invoking the Trading with the Enemy Act, the world could slip quickly into a real cold war, or even a hot one. The Biden administration needs to prepare a broad strategy to meet the China challenge, and it must include processes for accident avoidance, crisis management and constant high level communication. Otherwise, the result could be disastrous for China, the U.S. and the world.

2020/12/31,Georgia Voters Prepare to Decide the Senate,Commentary,https://www.wsj.com/articles/georgia-voters-prepare-to-decide-the-senate-11609460460,"Columbus, Ga.
Joe Biden won Georgia.
That statement isn’t as hard on Republicans’ ears as it was in early November. A hand recount that concluded Dec. 7, the Electoral College vote on Dec. 14, and the simple passing of time have made the result seem final, even among voters who doubt it.
But for weeks, widespread denial among Republicans obscured the result’s significance. With 49.5% of the vote to President Trump’s 49.3%, Mr. Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to carry Georgia. No Democrat since Bill Clinton had won any state in the once solidly Democratic Deep South, defined to include Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina along with the Peach State. 
Until this year, Southern Senate delegations seemed to have undergone a similar Republican realignment. With the exception of Alabama’s Doug Jones, who edged out a scandal-plagued Republican nominee in a 2017 special election (and was soundly defeated for a full term in November), no Democrat has won a Deep South Senate seat since 2008, and not one has unseated a Republican incumbent since 1986.
That may be about to change. Georgia’s two GOP senators were both on the ballot in November—and will be again Tuesday, as neither cleared the 50% threshold to avoid a runoff under Georgia election law. With Republicans holding 50 other Senate seats and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris casting a prospective tie-breaking vote, that means Georgia voters will decide which party controls the chamber.
Sen. Kelly Loeffler was appointed in January when Johnny Isakson retired for health reasons. “We need to show President Trump that Georgia is a red state!” she tells a crowd Sunday on the patio of a hotel in Columbus, the state’s third-largest city, which borders Alabama.
The remark is one of the few references she makes to the lame-duck president. Instead her speech looks ahead to the Biden administration. “If we lose,” she says, referring to herself and Sen. David Perdue, “we don’t just lose the Senate. We’ll lose the country—and we won’t get it back. We won’t get another chance.” 
Ms. Loeffler’s brief remarks don’t include a detailed critique of the next president’s plans—perhaps because she knows Georgia Republicans have it down pat. “It’s about our gun rights, and it’s about the economy,” attendee Jerry Williams, 67, tells me. “I was raised a Democrat, and I actually voted for Jimmy Carter —first mistake I ever made. But the Democratic Party has changed. I don’t even know what it is now.” To Mr. Williams, who is active in Columbus’s Republican group, Georgia Democrats have moved ever further from the state’s core values.
Yet the Biden win and the tight Senate races suggest that the state has moved too. Ms. Loeffler’s challenger, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, leads by 1.8 points, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average. Jon Ossoff, the documentary filmmaker vying for Mr. Perdue’s seat, leads by 0.8 point, although the incumbent beat him in the November tally, 49.7% to 47.9%. Mr. Williams attributes the shift to new residents in Atlanta and its suburbs: “There’s been a lot of growth around Fulton County, and that’s where you saw Biden’s numbers. And Gwinnett County”—northeast of Atlanta—“has flipped.”
With Georgia suddenly a swing state, voters have become prone to break it down county by county with the ease of a cable news pundit. “Muscogee is also historically Democrat,” Mr. Williams says. But that county, which is coterminous with Columbus, added little to Mr. Biden’s overperformance because “it isn’t growing like some of the other regions.”
As in the Atlanta area, the bulk of Democratic votes in Columbus are cast by black residents. “I hate to say it,” says Mr. Williams, who is white, “but the divide runs along racial lines.” Yet he echoes Ms. Loeffler in asserting that Georgia still has a conservative majority. A Democratic sweep in the runoffs would show that conservative activists like him “just didn’t fight hard enough.”
Across the state headed northeast is Athens, home of the University of Georgia’s main campus and a stronghold of the other demographic group that has trended Democratic: young college-educated whites. Peyton Oswald, a waitress at Jinya Ramen Bar downtown, hails from that group and rivals Mr. Williams in confidence for her own side. “There are more young people getting educated and getting involved,” she says. “People are more aware and they’re fighting for people of color, gay rights, Native lands, all of that.” Ms. Oswald, 22, had a traditional upbringing, but she’s thrilled rather than daunted by the social change she perceives: “I grew up in Conyers, and then Gainesville. My family was more conservative. And I’m a nonreligious bisexual woman.” She jumps back to work when two customers come in, but leaves with the parting cry, “Vote blue!”
The combination of youthful excitement and progressive sternness was in the air at the It’s Time to Vote rally Monday in Stonecrest, featuring both Democratic Senate candidates. Countless features of the event evoke the thought “only in 2020.” It’s a drive-in, with hundreds of cars parked in the lot of the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, a black megachurch. In place of an invocation, celebrity pastor Jamal Harrison Bryant (Mr. Warnock’s Morehouse College classmate) takes the stage in a camouflage jacket and tells the crowd that the runoffs are a chance to “make America great for the first time!” The event is hosted enthusiastically by Reginae Carter, whose father, rapper Lil Wayne, drew headlines in October when he endorsed Mr. Trump. And the candidates’ remarks are preceded by a three-act concert featuring a DJ who between numbers plays a sound effect of gunshots followed by shattering glass, with the volume on blast.
Eventually, the candidates show up and bring the sternness. Mr. Ossoff seeks to frame his and Mr. Warnock’s campaigns as part of a long tradition of Southern progress. “Think of how far we’ve come,” he says, “that your standard bearers are the young Jewish son of an immigrant and a black preacher who holds Martin Luther King’s pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church.” His invocations of the civil-rights movement aren’t merely symbolic. Citing the contemporary problems of racial violence and alleged voter suppression, he declares that he’ll go to the Senate to pass “a new Civil Rights Act” and “a new Voting Rights Act that will secure the sacred franchise.”
The implication is that the civil-rights movement continues today, literally, and that voting for Democrats is the most urgent way Americans are called to participate. Since the 1960s, black politicians have invoked the struggle against legal oppression to legitimize their candidacies—often with great personal credibility, as in the case of Atlanta Rep. John Lewis, who died in July. But that rhetorical move often exaggerates current racial problems—claiming, for example that police killings of blacks are widespread, or that the black vote in Georgia is being suppressed, despite increases in the black share of overall turnout in recent elections.
The most ambitious part of the rhetorical move is the insistence that conventional Democratic Party causes are part of the civil-rights struggle. Mr. Warnock puts on a clinic in this regard.
He begins by casting his opponent as a successor to segregationists: “I don’t know why Kelly Loeffler’s friends are QAnon conspiracists and white supremacists and former members of the Ku Klux Klan.” He recounts his two arrests for civil disobedience—at a 2014 Atlanta sit-in to urge Medicaid expansion and another in Washington in 2017 to protest Mr. Trump’s tax reform.
Progressives like to cite Martin Luther King’s belief that economic and social justice are inseparable. But the insinuation that tax and health-care policy are literally matters of civil rights is a move meant to shield their policies from criticism. If Democrats’ favored styles of redistribution are the only path to justice, any objection to them can be written off as racism. Policies like school choice, more closely tailored to the most urgent problems facing blacks today, are dismissed with the same false critique.
Young voters often accept these exaggerations. Older ones tend to take a humbler view of politics. After the rally, Dolores Washington, 78, expresses optimism about the progress Southern blacks have made, including in voter turnout. “It’s real. The more you do something, the more progress you’ll get,” she says, describing her years of volunteering on get-out-the-vote campaigns. Ms. Washington, a retired high-school principal, helped elect Eugene P. Walker in 1984, DeKalb County’s first black state senator. “We have worked so hard in the state of Georgia for voting inclusion,” she says. “We finally have a good system.”
It’s impossible to deny that Republicans face a growing challenge from both suburban and black voters. Idealistic and more-practical Democrats alike are energized by the feeling that they’ve succeeded in turning Georgia blue. For the GOP senators, holding the line may depend on convincing swing voters and their own base to discount the fervid rhetoric and remember their policy record.
Mr. Perdue pitches that message Tuesday at a rally in Jackson, a town of some 5,000. Addressing a large crowd from the porch of the local pizza restaurant, he laments Georgia’s choice to return the Democrats to the White House: “What do you call it when someone pushes the same button over and over again expecting a different result? Insanity!” Mr. Biden, he says, will follow President Obama in imposing “the same taxes and the same regulations that held the economy back. Except it will be even more. That’s like pushing the button harder and expecting a different result.” He touts the pre-pandemic economic rebound under Mr. Trump: “We proved what we stand for actually works!”
With a record number of early votes already in, all four candidates sought to make disciples of their supporters, sending them off to preach to like-minded stragglers. “This is the ‘saved’ right here,” Mr. Perdue tells the crowd. “We need to find the unsaved.” For decades, Republicans felt secure in their status as Georgia’s favored party, while the Democrats held out hope that their time would come. On Tuesday we’ll know if it has.

2020/12/31,"In 2021, All the World’s a Stage",Declarations,https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-2021-all-the-worlds-a-stage-11609460518,"You have to go into this year with dreams, there’s no other way to do it. We’re still in an epic struggle, and it will be a while before things settle down into some approximation of normal. Dreams are how we got through 2020, or maybe not dreams precisely but a picture you kept in your head that helped you keep going, that captured what you missed and will have again. It was a picture of When the Pandemic is Over and we carried it in our psychic wallets.
My friend John’s picture: He’s in Fenway Park, the seats are full and close together, and he orders a Fenway Frank and chowder, and the other people in the row pass them down without fear or masks. Someone gets a hit and no one’s afraid to cheer. He is certain this will come. 
My friend the professor would see this: He and his students are in a room, and he is teaching them. For what seems like forever they’ve been postage-size faces on Gallery View on Zoom, which is how they see him. But in his head they’re together and know each other and he’s Mr. Chips again, not Max Headroom. 
A friend who’s a reporter kept in her head the idea of future spontaneity. She’d be on the phone with a friend: Whatcha doin’? Wanna get in a car and get lost? What if we just show up and surprise them? Let’s see who’s in town. 
My vision of 2021, the picture I held of that future, came into my head in early summer. This would come: We are gathered in a darkened theater, 1,500 of us, for the first time since March 2020. The orchestra starts, the curtain rises, and on the stage a crowded old railroad coach is in full cry. The train conductor booms, “River City next station stop!” And in the audience applause starts, unplanned, just erupting, and the actors playing the salesmen on the train play through. “Ya can talk-talk-talk. . . . Ya can talk all ya wanna, but it’s different than it was.” Suddenly a tall man in a natty suit comes forward: “Gentlemen, you intrigue me. I think I’ll have to give Iowa a try.” It’s Professor Harold Hill, the Music Man. He’s played by Hugh Jackman. We’re at the revival that was supposed to open in 2020. Now pent-up emotion really breaks out and what builds is a wave of unstoppable cheers, and then we can’t help it, we stand. And Mr. Jackman understands this moment, and after a minute he stops the show, and in a great flourish, as if speaking for all the history of the theater past and present, makes a deep and graceful bow. As if theater itself were bowing to all of those by whom it lives. 
And all of us know: Theater is back. The thing we loved, that stands for New York City, that is this city, the stage, has returned. And we applaud for 4 minutes and 18 seconds straight, and in that time we realize we’ll never get over this moment, this first show when we knew the great pandemic was over. And life went on.
The great comeback of 2021 is surely coming, at least according to the new picture I have in my head, and it will be led and fed by the idea of pent-upness. There’s so much pent-up desire for joy out there. Surely it will begin to explode in late spring, with vaccines more available and a spreading sense that things are easing off, and be fully anarchic by summer. 
Growth will come back, people will burst out, it’s going to be exciting. Businesses will start to come back to office buildings and see if that works. The great newsrooms will be full and bustling with noise again, and the young hire will be given a desk, not a Zoom link. We will call old friends for dinner and meet at crowded restaurants and everyone will be grateful for each other. Some people will go a little crazy and say how about a long weekend in Paris, and we’ll do it and not only for fun but to see that Paris is still there. 
There will be a hunger to be out there again, en masse again. On the streets of my city at night it was once fairly common to see glamorous men in tuxedos and women in satin shawls. We are going to see them hailing a car and on their way to a party again. The young will come out of their apartments and flood into the streets dressed in all the colors in the world. 
There will be much wreckage to get through, no point in not seeing that. It is odd that after almost a year the government doesn’t seem to have its hands around the number of small-business closings. Yelp reported that 60% of its listed small businesses that had closed as of August would never reopen. An estimated 164,000 had closed, 98,000 of them permanently. The numbers may be higher: A study from the University of California, Santa Cruz found that in May, the number of small-business owners was “down by 2.2 million or 15 percent from February,” although it had risen 7% in April. 
There’s always a lot of churn in small businesses each year, but walk any city or town now, and there’s an unforgivingly targeted nature to this catastrophe. It’s not only “job loss” or even dream loss; small businesses are the beating heart of everything. Salons, restaurants, shoe stores—they’re where people go and gather. They keep the streets alive. They need support, and in my city it’s not only the pandemic doing them in. Real-estate firms have bought up buildings and closed the shops below to build expensive condos. They’re removing part of what made people want to live in the neighborhood, the stores and their street traffic, the sense of liveliness and the commerce they bring. 
What guts it will take the owners and workers of small business to keep going, or start again, or shift weight and go into something else, something new. 
The theologian Paul Tillich wrote about the difference between fear and anxiety. Fear is of something, you can name it and face it, and in the facing of it lift your own morale, show yourself what’s in you. Anxiety is amorphous; it doesn’t quite have an object, it’s a state. And so it’s harder to shake and no empowering necessarily comes from it. A lot of people this year will have to break down a generalized anxiety into specific fears and deal with them courageously.
America has been through so much this year—world-wide illness, lockdowns, death, sickness, searing arguments about how to handle it all. We tried to do what we had never done before, close everything down to fight a disease and each day, in real time, face the economic, social and cultural repercussions. The personal ones, too. It’s going to be the work of years to dig ourselves out fully, but there are many reasons to believe we can and will. 
My idea of an appropriate American attitude comes from Carl Sandburg, in his poem, “The People, Yes”: “This old anvil laughs at many broken hammers.” 
That wouldn’t be a bad picture to keep in our heads for 2021, the laughing anvil.

2020/12/31,States of Growth and Decline,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-of-growth-and-decline-11609460276,"President Trump is soon expected to submit to Congress state population counts from this year’s Census for reapportionment. Last week the Census Bureau gave a preview of what to expect, and blue-state Democrats might want to prepare their smelling salts in advance.
Sixteen mostly coastal and Rust Belt states lost population from July 2019 to July 2020, according to the Census Bureau’s annual population survey, and Illinois, West Virginia, New York, Connecticut, Mississippi and Vermont have shrunk since 2010. At the same time, many low-tax Sun Belt states have continued to attract newcomers.
The pandemic may have contributed to population losses in some states as city dwellers with means escaped to rental and vacation homes. Foreign immigration also fell after President Trump suspended new green cards in April. Some states, especially in the Northeast, experienced thousands of more deaths than usual due to Covid.
But the bureau’s annual population estimate captures only the first few months of the pandemic when migration generally declined as most people hunkered down. Geographic mobility increased over the summer and fall, and the pandemic seems to have accelerated migration flows that have been occurring for years. States such as New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and California have counted on foreign immigration offsetting net out-migration. That didn’t happen this year, so many states lost population for the first time in decades.
California’s population shrank for the first time as far back as records go (-69,532). According to a separate state government survey, a net 261,000 residents moved to other states during the period, the most in nearly 25 years. High housing costs have been driving out the middle class for years. But now many large businesses are shifting workforces to other states.
Last year Charles Schwab announced it is relocating its corporate headquarters to the Dallas region from San Francisco. Apple is building a new campus in Austin. Facebook this fall bought REI’s headquarters outside of Seattle. Oracle and Hewlett Packard Enterprise recently announced relocations to Texas. 
Other Democratic states that have taken their high earners for granted face a similar reckoning, only worse since they have older populations and are also losing more retirees. Over the last decade, Illinois has lost 243,102 in population, about the size of Peoria and Naperville combined. Only West Virginia (-3.7%) has lost a larger share of its population than Illinois (-2%). Other states in the Midwest including Indiana (4.1%), Iowa (3.7%), Kentucky (3%), Missouri (2.6%), Wisconsin (2.5%) and Michigan (0.9%) have added population since 2010, according to research outfit Wirepoints, so Democrats in Illinois can’t blame cold weather.
One culprit: Exorbitant property taxes. The Illinois Policy Institute reported an annual property tax bill of $30,201 on the Winnetka house featured in the movie “Home Alone,” which was recently valued at $1.26 million. That’s about 2.5 times more than a similarly valued home in California.
The elimination of the state-and-local tax (SALT) deduction in the 2017 GOP tax reform has magnified the pain of living and working in high-tax states. So it’s not surprising that most Democratic states in the Northeast last year lost population, led by New York (-126,355), Connecticut (-9,016) and New Jersey (-8,887). New Hampshire gained (+5,492) and doesn’t tax wage income.
By raising taxes again and again to pay for generous collective-bargained benefits, public unions are making Democratic states less competitive, much as private unions do to businesses. Note that states with the fastest-growing populations also tend to have right-to-work laws, which give workers a choice of whether to join a union. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has often complained about the United Auto Workers union, which has tried to organize his factory in Fremont, Calif. He’s locating Tesla’s new auto factory in Texas. Foreign auto makers have expanded in right-to-work southern states including Tennessee, South Carolina and Alabama.
Despite the pandemic, most Sun Belt states with low taxes and good business climates gained population last year, led by Texas (373,965), Florida (241,256), Arizona (129,558), North Carolina (99,439) and Georgia (81,997). Texas, Florida, Arizona, Tennessee and Idaho grew more than they did in the previous year. Six states have added more than one million people since 2010 including Texas (4.2 million), Florida (2.9 million), California (2.1 million), and North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia about a million each.
It’s hard to predict how this migration will affect the political balance in states and Congress, though California does seem likely to lose a seat in Congress for the first time. Many Republicans worry that migrants from high-tax states will import their liberal politics to conservative states. But then U.S. immigrants who fled socialism are also among the staunchest supporters of free markets.

2020/12/31,Hong Kong’s Political Prisoners,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kongs-political-prisoners-11609460193,"The crackdown continues in Hong Kong, and this week the Chinese government made an example of the territory’s most prominent political prisoners. 
Publisher Jimmy Lai is back in jail after Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal revoked his bail. A long-time democracy advocate and critic of the Communist Party, Mr. Lai faces multiple charges for participating in last year’s Hong Kong protests, and authorities have also charged him under the new national-security law, which effectively outlaws dissent. 
The maximum sentence is life in prison, and there’s no guarantee that Chinese authorities won’t extradite Mr. Lai to the mainland. A lower court enraged Beijing last week when it granted bail and allowed Mr. Lai to await his trial under house arrest as long as he refrained from giving interviews, posting on social media, or making public statements.
The prosecution cited Article 42 of the security law, which states that no bail can be granted “unless the judge has sufficient grounds for believing the criminal suspect or defendant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.” Mr. Lai poses no such threat. He has bravely chosen not to flee despite having a British passport, and China wants to make an example of him to stifle all criticism.
Meanwhile on the mainland, a Shenzhen court meted out harsh sentences for 10 Hong Kongers who were arrested as they fled by boat to Taiwan. Authorities wouldn’t let these thwarted refugees meet with the lawyers hired by their families, and on Wednesday the court sentenced the 10 to between seven months and three years, almost certainly to be spent in China’s opaque and notorious prison system. 
Beijing now considers it a criminal offense to attempt to flee persecution in Hong Kong. This is Soviet or North Korean behavior, and we hope that Joe Biden and his officials will speak plainly against it.

2020/12/31,A Buffalo Bills Miracle,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-buffalo-bills-miracle-11609460102,"Whether or not they make it to the Super Bowl, the Buffalo Bills have already pulled off a miracle victory: persuading New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to let 6,700 fans attend their playoff game next weekend.
The Bills have won the AFC East division for the first time in 25 years and will host their first home playoff game since 1996. Buffalo could use the morale boost. It sure hasn’t received one from the billions of dollars Mr. Cuomo has spent trying to revive the western New York economy. 
Mr. Cuomo has kept Bill fans locked out of the stadium all season, though 13 other NFL stadiums have allowed limited numbers to attend games. There has been only one report of a fan testing positive after an NFL game. Yet in November Mr. Cuomo proclaimed it would be “reckless” to let any fans into a stadium that could seat nearly 72,000.
Perhaps feeling the holiday spirit or pressure from upstate voters, Mr. Cuomo has reversed course. “We’re all feeling the excitement,” Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday. “We’ve all wanted the Buffalo Bills to be good, it’s been a long time, and that team has a charisma and personality that is infectious.”
The Governor’s plan requires all fans to be tested before the game and wear masks. The state also plans to hold drive-through rapid testing at the stadium, which he says would be a pilot for reopening businesses and live events. 
“This is not just about attending a football game,” Mr. Cuomo said. “We are trying to find a way to reopen businesses.” If it works there, he added, “can you do Madison Square Garden? Could you do a theater on Broadway? Could you do a certain capacity in a restaurant, so restaurants could start to reopen safely?”
We can’t “start 2021 with the expectation that the economy will reopen when the vaccine hits critical mass,” he noted. “We can’t take six months, nine months, 12 months of a closed-down economy. We can’t take the economic cost. We can’t take the psychological cost. We can’t take the emotional cost.”
For months Mr. Cuomo has needlessly shut down businesses despite precautions to operate safely. But we’re glad he may be seeing the light now, even if it took a football game.

2020/12/31,A Warning on Georgia’s Signature Match,Review & Outlook,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-warning-on-georgias-signature-match-11609460042,"Georgia’s audit of the November mail vote in Cobb County found “no fraudulent absentee ballots.” In a report Tuesday, the Secretary of State’s office explained how investigators double checked the signatures on 15,118 randomly chosen ballot envelopes. It’s a good warning to anybody contemplating shenanigans in Georgia’s Senate runoffs next week.
About 150,000 people in Cobb County voted by mail, so the sample was nearly 10% of the total. Most of the accepted signatures were clearly valid. Investigators ended up with 10 suspect envelopes. On eight of them, the signature “did not appear to be consistent with documents on record.” But once the voters were contacted, they confirmed the signatures were theirs. Handwriting can change, especially as people age.
That left two problem votes. One was missing a signature, and the voter “reported signing the front of the envelope only.” The other ballot was correctly voted, but then its envelope was “mistakenly signed by the elector’s spouse.” In both cases, the state said, Cobb County should have asked the voter to fix the mistake before accepting the ballot.
These are ordinary screw ups, not the mass fraud that President Trump claims. Two bad ballots out of 15,118 is an error rate of 0.013%. If you extrapolate that to Georgia’s 1,316,943 mail votes, it suggests 174 questionable ballots statewide. There are reasons to roll back mail voting, which could be a debacle if the margin were closer. But Mr. Trump lost Georgia by 12,000.
It’s good news that no fraud was found, yet some Trump supporters appear unwilling to accept defeat no matter the evidence. They include Mr. Trump, who tweeted: “When are we going to be allowed to do signature verification in Fulton County, Georgia?” The big difference is that in Cobb County a temporary election worker made a specific allegation to investigate.
Georgia has counted its ballots three times, including once by hand. State officials say signatures are verified twice, first when voters apply for absentee ballots and again as they’re mailed back. The state audited one of every 10 signatures in Cobb County, which Mr. Biden carried by 14 points. Imagine that an audit of Fulton County came out clean: Would Mr. Trump then admit he was wrong and concede the election? You know that answer.
Mr. Trump’s tweets aside, the audit of Cobb County does have the salutary effect of putting election workers on notice as Georgia nears its Senate runoffs on Jan. 5. Almost three million ballots have been cast already, and progressives want Democrats to take control of the Senate and go to town passing Mr. Biden’s agenda.
Yet election officials in blue counties, including Fulton, have now been warned: If there are credible allegations of failed or sloppy signature matching, state investigators will show up and pull 15,000 envelopes, maybe more. Knowing that ought to deter some mischief, while raising confidence of a fair result on Jan. 5.

2020/12/31,The White House Can’t Dodge Responsibility,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-white-house-cant-dodge-responsibility-11609459833," Scott Atlas’s op-ed “A Pandemic of Misinformation” (Dec. 22) contributes to the problem he laments. He writes that states directed their own pandemic policies, with governors and local officials responsible for outcomes. A lack of leadership from the White House left them no other choice. For example, Washington’s Opening Up America Again guidelines were well-received, but the administration promptly ignored them, pushing states to open before reaching important health benchmarks.
 Jared Kushner relayed President Trump’s posture to Bob Woodward : The states would be responsible for the public-health burden while he’d own the reopening. “The opening is going to be very popular,” Mr. Kushner said.
An October Gallup report concluded that “the most important factor in Americans’ decision to [take Covid precautions seriously] is exposure to accurate information about the pandemic from sources they trust.” Mr. Trump played down Covid’s seriousness, belittled masks, flaunted CDC guidelines and ran a White House that became a Covid epicenter. The government’s investment in vaccines must be applauded. Otherwise, its actions fell short.
David Stone
Birmingham, Mich.
Trying to shift blame for the bungled U.S. Covid response, Dr. Atlas accuses the media of politicizing it. But the epicenter of politicization was in the White House, with pronouncements that Covid was merely the flu and denigrating remarks about masking. The president made public-health measures political by demanding allegiance to his own nonscientific facts.
Dr. Atlas cites 50 different state policies as exculpatory of federal blame, when it was instead a failure of federal leadership. He argues that lockdowns failed, when it was actually softer restrictions that were ineffective, undermined by the president and Dr. Atlas. Harder lockdowns are now the only tool left for exasperated public-health officials. And any credit for vaccine development must be tempered by poorly planned distribution.
Dr. Atlas ends by denouncing the media and scientific journals. What he is actually raging about is the refusal of good journalists and scientists to support the stream of falsehoods promulgated by the president. 
On Nov. 3, the majority of Americans rejected living in a universe of “alternative facts,” hopefully soon closing this deadliest of anti-science chapters in our history.

2020/12/31,Will Biden Reprise Obama’s Economic Policy?,Letters,https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-biden-reprise-obamas-economic-policy-11609459779," William A. Galston tees up Washington’s next massive stimulus package as essential to avoid a double-dip recession (“Can Team Biden Prevent a Recession?” Politics & Ideas, Dec. 23). Mr. Galston is concerned that “the pace of job growth has declined for five straight months and may have ceased in December.” Normal cyclical forces could be swamped by “structural changes” that were accelerated by the pandemic.
This may be unsettling, but the pace of job growth was destined to fall after a fairly rapid recovery from an extraordinary spike in job losses. Compare this with the 2007-09 recession. The unemployment rate peaked around 10% nine months into President Obama’s first year and didn’t drop to 6.7% for 50 months until December 2013. In 2020 the unemployment rate soared to nearly 15% in April and dropped to 6.7% only seven months later in November.
Secular stagnation was the excuse made for eight years of modest growth and slow labor-market recovery under Mr. Obama’s stewardship. It seems that Mr. Biden’s will be structural changes, but one guesses his solutions will be similar. Washington will pick up the economic slack with more stimulus, more federal “investments” in favored industries and state and local governments, more regulations and higher taxes. 
How many trillions of dollars of federal spending will it take to get back to President Trump’s prepandemic unemployment rate of 3.5%? The rate didn’t get below 4.7% during the Obama-Biden years. Let’s hope the Biden-Harris solution isn’t to hire five million more federal workers.

Taylor’s pleasing review of “The Unquiet Englishman” (Bookshelf, Dec. 26) notes the biographer’s refutation of Graham Greene’s claim in his 1971 autobiography “A Sort of Life” to have visited a dentist merely to ward off a bout of ennui. As a Catholic familiar with the British character from many travels there and from the readings required for a B.A. in English literature circa 1974, I didn’t for a moment think Greene would see a dentist for such a pain-free reason, given the parsimonious nature of the native Englishman, straitened by Roman Catholicism’s penury, and the toleration of poor dentition in the British Isles generally. Of course it was an abscess.

2020/12/31,Cuomo Needs A New Excuse,Best of the Web,https://www.wsj.com/articles/cuomo-needs-a-new-excuse-11609449491,"Politicians and media pundits have often blamed the population density of New York City for the country’s highest per capita Covid death tolls in New Jersey and New York. Now they need to explain the slow pace of vaccinations.
Around two out of every thousand people in New York and New Jersey have died with Covid this year, roughly double the rate in Florida and Texas. By placing strict limits on individual liberty while also failing to prioritize the protection of the elderly, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D.) has achieved the ignominy of presiding over both the highest per capita Covid death rate and the nation’s highest unemployment rate. 
It’s a remarkable occurrence that New Jersey joblessness exceeds even the pain in states like Hawaii and Nevada which rely heavily on the hospitality and travel industries. New Jersey’s unemployment rate is also much higher than Florida’s. Across the Hudson River from the Garden State, New York’s grim stats have been almost as awful as New Jersey’s. Maybe it’s all about the highly populated metro area.
One might assume that population density would be more help than hindrance in a vaccination campaign, but according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control, New Jersey and New York have barely been able to climb to the level of mediocrity. 
The vaccination effort has only recently begun and perhaps reporting lags around the holidays are obscuring the full story. But so far the national leader in administering Covid vaccinations is West Virginia. Perhaps Mr. Murphy and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D.) can learn from the Mountain State example.
WAJR radio reports from Morgantown:
The Bluefield Daily Telegraph has more good news. “On Jan. 19, all elementary and middle school students can return to school five days a week,” reports Charles Boothe, who reports on a press conference held by Gov. Jim Justice (R., W.Va.):
Compared with New Jersey and New York, the governance of West Virginia seems almost like heaven.
